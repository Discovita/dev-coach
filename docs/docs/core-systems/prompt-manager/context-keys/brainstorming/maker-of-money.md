# Maker of Money Brainstorming Approach

**This is a Single Identity Category**: Clients typically develop one primary "Maker of Money" identity that represents how they channel energy into generating income.

**Key Distinction**: This is about income generation to meet needs and desires—separate from career fulfillment or passion alignment. You need money, not necessarily a fulfilling career.

**Energy-Based Focus**: Focus on which identity feels most inspiring and sustainable for making money, not what they think "should" work. Often the identity that generates income most easily is different from what clients expect.

## Category-Specific Approach

**Language Elevation**: Help transform job-focused language into identity-based language:
- "Sales rep" → "Connector" or "Builder" 
- "Manager" → "Leader" or "Organizer"
- "Freelancer" → "Creator" or "Specialist"

**Key Questions to Explore**:
- "Who wakes up in the morning and makes money in your life?"
- "Which identity feels most energizing for generating income?"
- "Where do opportunities flow most naturally to you?"

## Natural Resistance Responses

**"I should be able to make money from my passion"**:
- "What if your passion is for you, and your Maker of Money serves your passion?"

**"This doesn't feel meaningful enough"**:
- "The meaning comes from what this income enables you to do and be."

**"I don't know what makes money"**:
- "Where do people naturally come to you for help or solutions?"

## Transitioning to Keeper of Money

**Create a custom transition** that emphasizes the paradigm shift between making and keeping money. Use their specific situation and newly identified Maker of Money.

**Examples of Leigh Ann's natural conversation flow for inspiration only** (don't use as templates):
- Emphasizing different energies: *"The Maker of Money is one energy and vibe, and the Keeper of Money is a totally different vibe and set of activities..."*
- Highlighting the breakthrough: *"A lot of people focus on making money. Not many focus on keeping money. They're very different energies."*
- Personalizing the shift: *"The person who [reference their Maker of Money work] is very different than the budgeting, investing, growing money person."*

**Your transition should:**
- Emphasize that making and keeping money are different energies
- Reference their specific Maker of Money identity
- Frame keeping money as equally important but different
- Build excitement about this paradigm shift
