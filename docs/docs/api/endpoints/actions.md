# Actions

## Base URL

`/actions/`

## Overview

The ActionViewSet provides read-only access to coaching actions performed by the system. Actions represent the operations that the coach performs during coaching sessions, such as creating identities, transitioning phases, or updating user data. This endpoint is primarily used for admin interfaces, action history tracking, and conversation reconstruction.

**Important**: All endpoints require authentication. Regular users can only see their own actions, while admin users can see all actions.

## Notes

- All endpoints require authentication.
- Regular users can only see their own actions.
- Admin users can see all actions and use the `for-user` endpoint.
- Actions are ordered by timestamp (newest first) in list responses.
- The `by-coach-message` endpoint helps trace which actions were triggered by specific coach messages.
- Action parameters are stored as JSON and validated to ensure they are objects.
- Actions can only be linked to coach messages, not user messages.
- The list endpoint uses a simplified serializer to reduce response size.
- Update this document whenever the API changes.
