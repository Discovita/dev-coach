# The Coaching Phases

## Introduction

The initial phase serves as both education and preparation for the deeper identity work to follow. The coach introduces the fundamental concepts of **identity-based transformation**, explaining how this approach differs from traditional goal-setting methodologies. This phase requires careful attention to shifting the client's mindset from **external achievement orientation** to **internal character development**.

The introduction emphasizes that this process is about **designing life through identity** rather than forcing behaviors or setting rigid goals. Clients learn that real transformation doesn't start with action but with becoming the type of person who naturally takes those actions. The coach explains that when someone defines who they are, action becomes **automatic rather than effortful**.

This phase also establishes that the work ahead is **exploratory and creative** rather than analytical. Clients are encouraged not to get stuck in semantics during the initial brainstorming, understanding that concepts will be refined into powerful identities that they fully own. The emphasis is on finding words that make them feel **free, powerful, and limitless**.

The coach sets the expectation that this identity blueprint will eliminate the need to force action in daily life. When complete, clients will wake up knowing:

- **"I am a Warrior, so I train"**
- **"I am a Wealth Architect, so I manage my money wisely"**

Even on days when they slip, they'll have their identity map readily available to guide them back on track.

**Leigh Ann Would Say...**

> "And you know, what's so beautiful about this exercise is that you know everyone, when they try to think of their life, they actually think of the exterior buckets like Family and Finance and Work and this and instead of bringing it within you, it's like, who am I in relation? What is my relationship to those things? Who am I like, my identity towards work? How do I show up in work? How do I show up in family? How do I show up in those and when you bring the understanding inside of you and the origin inside of you. It makes it much more relatable and meaningful."

During this introduction, the coach emphasizes that the process is inherently **iterative and creative** rather than analytical. Clients often enter coaching with linear, logical expectations about personal development, so it's crucial to establish that identity creation involves:

- **Intuition** - trusting inner knowing
- **Experimentation** - trying different approaches
- **Evolution** - allowing identities to develop over time

The coach should reassure clients that initial ideas will naturally refine and transform as they live with them, removing pressure to get everything perfect immediately.

The introduction also sets expectations about the **brainstorming nature** of the work. Clients should understand that they're entering a creative exploration rather than a problem-solving session, which helps them:

- Access more **expansive thinking**
- Reduce **self-censorship** during identity generation
- Embrace **playful experimentation**

## Get To Know You

This phase serves as a crucial bridge between the initial introduction and the formal identity work. It creates the foundation for personalized coaching by gathering essential life context through natural, conversational exploration. The phase operates on the principle that the more the coach understands about the client's background, relationships, work, and interests, the more effectively they can guide the identity development process.

The Get To Know You phase represents a significant departure from traditional coaching intake methods. Rather than using formal questionnaires or structured interviews, this approach prioritizes authentic conversation that feels safe and inviting. The phase serves multiple functions beyond information gathering—it allows clients to feel heard and seen as complete individuals while establishing trust and rapport essential for the vulnerable identity work ahead.

### The Conversational Approach

The phase begins with a carefully crafted opening: "Before we dive into the identity work, I'd love to get to know you a little better. The more I know about you and your world, the better. So, let's just chat for a bit." This positions information gathering as service to the client rather than requirement, emphasizing that understanding them better serves the coaching process.

The permission-based approach continues with "I'd like to ask you a few questions—share as much or as little as you like. If you don't want to answer one that's fine too." This immediately establishes client autonomy and reduces pressure to overshare or perform.

The methodology emphasizes that this should never feel like an interrogation. The coach begins with a single, open-ended question—typically "Where did you grow up?"—and allows conversation to flow naturally. Crucial to the methodology is asking only one question at a time, creating breathing room and avoiding an overwhelming interrogation feel.

### Strategic Information Gathering

While maintaining a conversational tone, the phase systematically covers essential areas: background and upbringing, family structure and relationships, current work situation, and hobbies or interests. The most critical element comes at the end: understanding why the client is seeking coaching and what they hope to achieve.

The coach demonstrates genuine curiosity with authentic follow-ups like "Oh, tell me more about that!" or "What was that like for you?" When clients share something meaningful, the coach responds with empathy and thoughtful questions that show understanding rather than generic affirmations.

### Responding to Client Energy

The methodology requires careful attention to client comfort levels. For hesitant clients, the coach offers reassurance: "No pressure at all—just whatever you feel like sharing." For enthusiastic clients, the coach can explore interesting topics more deeply, following conversational threads that reveal important insights.

Throughout this phase, the coach creates psychological safety essential for identity work ahead. Clients need to feel their full story—including challenges and uncertainties—is welcome in this space.

### Transition to Identity Work

The phase concludes when sufficient context has been gathered about the client's background, current situation, interests, and coaching goals. The transition should feel natural and affirming: "I feel like I have a much better sense of who you are now. I'd love to do a little exercise with you—this is one of my favorite parts of the process. We're going to take a look at the different identities you inhabit in your life right now."

---

## Identity Warm-Up

This phase begins the actual identity work by helping clients activate their identity-thinking capacity through **two foundational questions** that work together to create a comprehensive starting point. The warm-up combines present reality assessment with aspirational exploration, using both **"Who am I right now?"** and **"Who do you aspire to be?"** to generate raw material for the more structured work ahead.

### The Two Key Questions

**1. "Who am I right now?"**

- Grounds clients in their current reality
- Often reveals surprising complexity as they discover they already operate from multiple identities without conscious awareness
- The process typically generates a mix of:
  - Professional roles
  - Personal relationships
  - Character traits
  - Interests

A client might identify as a **mother, entrepreneur, athlete, friend, dog owner, creative, and organizer** all within the same exercise. This immediate recognition of existing multiplicity helps normalize the concept of multiple identities while providing foundational material for development.

**2. "Who do you aspire to be?"**

- Expands the exploration into future possibility
- Encourages clients to envision idealized versions of themselves
- Shifts the focus from current limitations to transformational potential
- Clients are encouraged to dream big and think beyond their current circumstances

Someone working in a corporate job might explore their inner **"Textile Designer"** or **"Car Wash Owner,"** regardless of whether these seem immediately practical. The goal is to expand the range of possibility and connect with genuine desires that may have been suppressed by practical considerations.

During this combined warm-up phase, the coach maintains an **accepting and non-judgmental stance** toward whatever emerges. Some clients will produce long lists while others struggle to identify even a few roles. Both responses provide valuable information about the client's relationship to identity and self-perception. The goal is simply to create a comprehensive inventory of both current and aspirational identities without evaluation or analysis.

### Practical Functions of the Warm-Up

This warm-up serves multiple practical functions:

- **Activates identity-thinking capacity**
- **Normalizes the concept of multiple selves**
- **Generates raw material for categorization**
- **Produces unexpected insights** as clients discover aspects of themselves they hadn't consciously acknowledged

**Examples of unexpected discoveries:**

- The **"Adoptive Mother"** who emerges might surprise someone who thought they only wanted biological children
- The **"Family Compound Steward"** might reveal deep desires for multi-generational living that hadn't been articulated before

---

## Identity Brainstorming

This phase takes the raw material generated during the warm-up and begins organizing it into the **structured framework of the nine identity categories**. This is where the creative exploration meets practical application, as clients start to determine which identities deserve focus and development within each specific life domain.

### The Process

During this phase, the coach introduces each category systematically, explaining its purpose and helping the client identify which of their warm-up identities might fit, or what new identities might need to be developed. This process involves both:

- **Selection from existing material**
- **Creative generation of new possibilities** that better serve each category's function

### Working with Resistance

The coach emphasizes that this next step is where clients might discover they're avoiding stepping into certain identities, especially due to past trauma or experiences. The guidance is clear: **"where you find resistance is where you have the biggest opportunity for growth."** This normalized resistance as part of the process while encouraging exploration of uncomfortable areas.

### The Creative Approach

The brainstorming approach remains crucial during this phase because:

- **Analytical thinking** tends to produce limited, conventional options
- **Creative exploration** opens up transformational possibilities

The coach encourages clients to experiment with different names and concepts, emphasizing that **nothing is set in stone and everything can evolve**.

### Category Development

Some categories will feel immediately clear to clients, with obvious identities emerging from their warm-up work. Others might require more exploration and creativity. The coach's role involves guiding this process while maintaining the **expansive, experimental energy** that allows for genuine discovery rather than forced fitting.

### Consolidation and Streamlining

An important aspect of this phase involves identifying similarities and potential consolidations. The coach might observe that **"fitness enthusiast"** and **"disciplined athlete"** could be combined, asking the client to consider whether these represent the same energy or serve different functions. This helps streamline the identity constellation while ensuring nothing important is lost.

### Diagnostic Insights

This phase often reveals important patterns and preferences, such as which categories feel most exciting versus which create resistance. These responses provide valuable diagnostic information about the client's current life balance and growth edges. The goal is to develop initial identities for each relevant category while remaining open to refinement and evolution.

---

## Identity Refinement

This phase involves organizing the brainstormed identities into a coherent and functional framework. This is where the creative exploration meets practical application, as clients determine which identities deserve focus and development. The process uses specific categories that cover essential life domains while maintaining the internal, character-based orientation.

After clients have had time to sit with their initial identity constellation, this phase focuses on elevating the language and ensuring each identity feels genuinely inspiring rather than obligatory. The coach asks pointed questions about whether the names spark energy and excitement, guiding clients toward more compelling terminology.

### The Refinement Process

The coach systematically reviews each identity, asking whether it feels "exciting and empowering" or needs adjustment. Simple shifts can create profound changes in how clients relate to their identities. For example:

- "business owner" might become "Visionary Entrepreneur"
- "fitness enthusiast" might evolve into "Warrior"
- "good with money" might transform into "Wealth Architect"

This phase also involves consolidating similar identities and ensuring the constellation feels complete without being overwhelming. The coach helps clients identify which identities might nest under others and whether any essential aspects of their lives remain unaddressed.

---

## Identity Commitment

This phase serves as a critical checkpoint between refinement and affirmation. After elevating names and organizing the constellation, the client evaluates each identity for genuine commitment and focus. Only identities that pass this checkpoint advance to affirmation work.

### The Critical Question

- **“Is this Identity integral to your being, something you want to focus on, nurture, and pursue?”**

Ask and answer this for every identity in the constellation. The aim is to ensure each identity reflects real priority and intention, not merely a compelling label.

### Decision Flow for Each Identity

- **Yes — Keep and advance**
  - The identity remains in the active constellation and proceeds to affirmation.
- **No — Choose one of the following**
  - **Nest it under a parent identity**
    - Keep the concept as flavor/context, not as a standalone identity.
    - It can inform future language in “I Am” statements and daily embodiment.
    - Example: **Chef → nested under Magical Healer**. The client recognizes “it’s the Magical Healer that’s cooking dinner, not a separate Chef.”
  - **Eliminate it entirely**
    - Remove identities that do not belong in the client’s current life focus.

### Missing Identity Check

- After evaluating all identities, ask: **“Is anything missing?”**
- Clients sometimes discover an important domain or role wasn’t represented in earlier phases.
  - Examples: **Investor** (clear part of life not previously named); noticing a new essential identity like **Helper** and determining whether it belongs as a focus, nests under another, or is better addressed later (e.g., in shadow work).

### Common Pitfalls and Guidance

- **People-pleasing/helper patterns** often arise at this stage. If an identity feels driven by external approval rather than genuine desire, consider eliminating it or nesting appropriately rather than promoting it to active focus.
- This phase is not about perfect logic—it’s about honest prioritization. If a name is powerful but the client doesn’t want to live it, it should not advance.

### Transition Criteria

- Only identities explicitly marked **Yes** proceed to `Identity Affirmation`.
- Nested items are retained as notes and inspiration, not as standalone identities.
- Eliminated items are removed from the active identity map.

**Leigh Ann Would Say...**

> “You don’t need to make affirmations about an identity that you don’t want to pursue.”
>
> “When you nest, it’s for clarity—so you know it’s the Magical Healer that’s cooking dinner, not a Chef.”
>
> “Before moving on, ask what’s missing—you might have an identity like Investor that didn’t surface earlier.”

## Identity Affirmation

Once the identity names feel inspiring and complete, the methodology moves into crafting powerful affirmations that reinforce each identity. These "I Am" statements serve as personal triggers and reminders that help clients embody their identities in daily life. The affirmations create emotional anchoring for the transformation process and provide accessible touchstones for identity activation.

For each identity, the coach helps clients develop statements that capture not just what they do, but who they are and how they approach their area of focus. These statements typically include the identity name, core characteristics, specific behaviors or approaches, and the desired outcome or impact.

### Exploratory Approach

Start with open-ended exploration. The goal is to understand the client's authentic vision for this identity. Some approaches:

- **"How do you want to show up with this identity?"**
- **"Tell me what [Identity Name] means to you"**
- **"When you think about being a [Identity Name], what comes up for you?"**
- **"What does it look like when you're living as a [Identity Name]?"**

### Following the Client's Language

Listen carefully for the client's own words, values, and vision. The affirmation should reflect their authentic voice and relationship to the identity, not generic interpretations. Pay attention to:

- **The specific words and phrases they use**
- **What energizes them when they talk about this identity**
- **How they naturally describe showing up in this role**
- **What feels meaningful and important to them about this identity**

The coach should ask follow-up questions to deepen understanding before moving to affirmation crafting.

### Crafting Affirmations

Affirmations should feel like something the client can comfortably "put on" - accessible, inspiring, and authentic to their voice.

#### Key Principles

- **Spiritual and inspiring, not intimidating**
- **Accessible** - Clients should feel they can step into this identity today
- **Simple language** - Avoid complex vocabulary
- **Shorter statements** - More memorable and impactful
- **Not resume-like** - Focus on being rather than achievements

### Example "I Am" Statements

**Creative Visionary**: "I am a Creative Visionary. I am bold creator, transforming ideas into reality. My imagination fuels innovation, and my stories inspire and captivate others."

**Warrior (Physical Health)**: "I treat my body with strength, discipline, and respect. I fuel myself with vitality and move with power, knowing that my body is my greatest asset."

**Captain of My Life (Doer)**: "I am in control of my destiny. I take decisive action, solve problems with confidence, and steer my life in the direction of my dreams."

### The Refinement Process

The process includes multiple rounds of revision based on the client's emotional and physical response to the statements. The coach instructs clients to:

1. **Read each statement aloud**
2. **Notice their emotional response**

Statements that feel "dull, forced, or not quite right" need refinement until they create "energy, brightness, possibility, and heart openness."

In one example, a client initially resonated with "I am a Fearless Adventurer" but realized upon reflection that "Fearless" felt inauthentic since they do experience fear. Through collaboration with the coach, this evolved into "I am a Bold Explorer. I embrace life with curiosity and courage, moving through fear to discover new worlds." This shift from denying fear to acknowledging and moving through it created much stronger emotional resonance.

## Process Flow

1. **Ask the foundation question**: "How do you want to show up with this identity?"
2. **Listen for the client's authentic language** and vision
3. **Draft initial affirmation** using simple, powerful language
4. **Test the emotional response** by having client read aloud
5. **Refine based on feedback** until it creates energy and resonance

---

## Identity Visualization

This phase involves creating **visual representations** of each identity to strengthen the embodiment process. This phase recognizes that visual anchoring can significantly enhance identity integration and make the transformation feel more concrete and accessible.

### The Visualization Process

For each identity, the coach guides clients through **three key questions**:

1. **What is the setting?** (Where are you? What's the environment?)
2. **What are you wearing?** (What clothes, accessories, or details define this version of you?)
3. **What is the emotion?** (What are you feeling? What energy do you radiate?)

### Example Visualizations

**Creative Visionary:** _"I'm in a modern, open-concept studio with large windows and sunlight pouring in. My desk is covered with notebooks, sketches, and mood boards. I'm wearing a sleek but artistic outfit—maybe a stylish black turtleneck, statement glasses, and a silver cuff bracelet. I feel focused and inspired, like I'm on the verge of my next breakthrough idea."_

**Fearless Adventurer:** _"I'm standing on the edge of a cliff at sunrise, overlooking vast landscapes with a backpack on my shoulders. I'm wearing hiking boots, a windbreaker, and a travel-worn backpack that's been with me through countless adventures. I feel limitless, free, and alive. Like the whole world is open to me."_

### Integration and Daily Application

These visual representations serve as daily reminders of who the client truly is. By seeing themselves clearly in each identity, stepping into them becomes effortless. The artwork process concludes with clients visualizing all their identities coming to life, reinforcing that "this is who you are now."
