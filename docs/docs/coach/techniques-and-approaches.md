# Techniques and Approaches

## Working with Resistance

Resistance often appears during identity exploration, particularly around categories that touch on vulnerable or overdeveloped areas. Rather than pushing through resistance, skilled coaches recognize it as valuable information about where the most transformational work might occur. The phrase "where you find resistance, you find the juicy stuff" captures this principle perfectly.

And it's so great because it's a fun, creative project, and like, the way that it changes people's life, just deciding these things, and there's more exercises that we will do. But just deciding these things the way it changes people's lives, it's like amazing, because it just seeps into the subconscious and it becomes like acceptable to be the best part of yourself."

When clients resist naming certain identities, the coach might acknowledge the resistance directly while maintaining curiosity rather than pressure. Sometimes this involves circling back to difficult categories after building confidence with easier ones. Other times it means exploring the stories or beliefs that create the resistance before attempting to name the identity.

The goal is never to force clients into identities that don't feel authentic, but rather to help them distinguish between genuine misalignment and protective resistance that might be limiting their growth.

## Elevating Language and Inspiration

One of the coach's most important functions involves helping clients find language that inspires rather than diminishes. Many people initially describe themselves in mundane or even negative terms, calling themselves "workaholic" instead of "Dedicated Creator" or "control freak" instead of "Meticulous Orchestrator."

This linguistic elevation isn't about denial or false positivity, but rather about finding accurate and empowering ways to describe genuine strengths and qualities. The right name for an identity should make the client feel energized and proud rather than resigned or diminished.

Sometimes this process involves several iterations as clients experiment with different terms and notice their internal response. The coach might suggest alternatives while encouraging clients to trust their intuitive sense of what feels most authentic and inspiring. The goal is finding words that create what clients describe as "a surge of energyâ€”like a puzzle piece snapping into place in your heart."

The refinement process also addresses authenticity concerns. When a client initially chose "Fearless Adventurer" but later realized "I don't always feel fearless," the coach helped them find "Bold Explorer" instead, acknowledging that "it acknowledges the fear but also my willingness to move through it." This demonstrates how the right language honors actual experience while still inspiring growth.

> "And your job is to choose something that excites you, that fucking fires up to get out there, and and, and maybe Contractor and Realtor and all those are just under your Business Woman or or Abundant Queen or whatever the fuck it is. You know what I mean, like, however you want to couch it, so that you know when you're going to do this, when you're going to do realtor work, or where you're going to show up for Planet Fitness, like you're showing up with Abundant Queen energy, because that's what you're doing."

This linguistic elevation isn't about denial or false positivity, but rather about finding accurate and empowering ways to describe genuine strengths and qualities. The right name for an identity should make the client feel energized and proud rather than resigned or diminished.
