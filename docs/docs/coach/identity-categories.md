# The 9 Identity Categories

The Dev Coach system organizes identities into nine distinct categories that cover all aspects of life. Each category represents a different area where you can develop and embody specific identities that align with your authentic self.

---

## 1. Passions and Talents

This category encompasses the traits, skills, and interests that make someone uniquely themselves. Unlike the other categories that typically involve single identities, the **Passions category can include multiple aspects** because these represent the foundational elements of personality and capability. Examples might include "Designer," "Meticulous Executor," "Communicator," or "Health Aficionado."

**Leigh Ann Would Say...**

> "The very first category is your **Passions**. So these are the things that make you uniquely you. They're kind of your personality, your skills that you've developed, things you like. People are Musicians or Bookworms or Designers or whatever so. And this is a multiple category. You can choose as many as you want, but again, you don't want 10, you know, but things that are your Passions that kind of define you."

The coach helps clients identify their most energizing and natural characteristics, often those that others consistently recognize and appreciate. These identities should feel both authentic to who the client already is and inspiring for who they're becoming. The key is finding language that elevates rather than diminishes these qualities, transforming "hard worker" into **"Meticulous Executor"** or "health nut" into **"Holistic Wellness Guide."**

## 2. Maker of Money

This category addresses the client's relationship to income generation. The **"Maker of Money"** represents the identity that channels energy into creating financial resources to meet specific needs and desires.

**Key Insight**: Money is a necessity, not a career construct. Everyone needs money, not necessarily a career. This distinction is crucial because it frees clients from the limiting belief that their income source must align with their passions or provide deep fulfillment. **Passion fulfillment and money generation can be entirely separate pursuits.**

**Leigh Ann Would Say...**

> "So the next category is the **Maker of Money**. Who is your maker of money? And this is a really good question for you right now, as you step into this new frontier, is like, who is your Maker of Money? Like, is it, is it an entrepreneur? Is that the eventual goal and or is it a is it a Meticulous Organizer? Is it like, who is making the money? And the question is about, like, through what do you channel your energy that's going to inspire you when you go to make money?"

The coaching conversation often reveals important distinctions between what clients think should make them money and what actually does. Someone might logically believe their "Organized Project Manager" should be their primary earner, but discovery work reveals that opportunities and income flow most easily through their **"Creative Designer"** identity. This insight can be transformational, redirecting energy toward naturally abundant and more inspired paths rather than forcing success through less aligned, more rigid, and expected approaches.

**Key Coaching Insight**: Help clients understand they need money, not necessarily a fulfilling career. As illustrated by the example: "I need a job" becomes "No, you don't, you need money." This distinction frees clients from limiting beliefs that income sources must align with passions.

The coach should explore both the practical and energetic aspects of money-making, helping clients identify which identity feels most inspiring and sustainable for income generation. This often involves releasing limiting beliefs about what kinds of identities are "allowed" to be profitable, while honoring that passion fulfillment and money generation can be entirely separate pursuits. This category is specifically about making money to satisfy particular needs, not about finding career fulfillment or aligning passion with income.

## 3. Keeper of Money

While the **Maker** generates income, the **Keeper** manages, allocates, and grows financial resources for an entirely different purpose and with a different energetic function that requires its own distinct identity. This is about clients choosing what kind of financial life they want to have and then creating that reality.

For example, some people want opulence, luxury and glamor—it's about freeing them to be honest about what they truly want and letting that true, deep inspiration fuel them forward. Others are truly minimalist and value different things; it's about clearing the clutter for them and letting them live in a way that feels aligned and light, if that's what they crave. Giving people the options and path to opt out of consumerist materialism and go after what they really want. When people are truly aligned with their own highest desires is when they can blast off towards the life they really want, which is different for everyone.

**Leigh Ann Would Say...**

> "So I have another exciting paradigm shifting question, who is your **Keeper of Money**? Because the Maker of Money is one energy and one vibe and set of activities, and the Keeper of Money is a totally different vibe and set of activities... and I love the housekeeping, and housekeeping is, like, really important. And I think that when it comes to, like, your Keeper of Money, you don't want it to be like small bean counting, you want it to be expansive."

Examples might include **"Empire Builder,"** **"Castle Keeper,"** or **"Wise Steward."** The language should feel empowering and abundant rather than restrictive or fear-based. This identity handles budgeting, investing, and financial planning from a place of empowerment rather than anxiety.

Many clients initially resist or may have never even considered separating these functions, wanting their Maker of Money to also handle money management. However, the energies required for generating versus managing resources are often quite different, and acknowledging this distinction can eliminate internal confusion and improve performance in both areas.

## 4. Personal Appearance and Presence

This category addresses how clients show up physically in the world, including style, grooming, home environment, and overall aesthetic presence. Many people have complex relationships with appearance-based identities, either dismissing them as superficial or feeling overwhelmed by perfectionistic standards.

**Leigh Ann Would Say...**

> "The next category is **personal appearance**. This is an area that many people overlook, but it can have a significant impact on your life. Consider: How do you want to be perceived by the world? How do you show up, both in how you look and how you present yourself? In today's world, people often form impressions instantly based on appearance—sometimes in positive ways, sometimes in negative ways. Your grooming, style, and the way you carry yourself can influence how others respond to you, and also reflect how you care for yourself. It's easy to let this aspect slip by, but being intentional about your personal appearance can be a powerful way to support your identity and goals. For example, you might choose identities like **Model**, **Fit Phenom**, **Dapper Executive**, or **Casual Creative**."

The coach's role involves helping clients claim this aspect of themselves in an empowering way that aligns with their values and personality. Someone might embrace their **"Elegant Icon"** energy while another connects with their **"Creative Bohemian"** or **"Regal Presence."** The identity should feel inspiring and authentic rather than imposed or imitative.

This category often reveals important information about how clients value themselves. Resistance to naming an appearance identity is common as personal appearance is an indicator of self-worth, self-love, self-care and a reflection of how people manage themselves and the way they show up in the world. Enthusiasm suggests an area of natural strength and joy.

## 5. Spiritual Connection

The spiritual category addresses the client's relationship to transcendence, meaning, and connection to something greater than themselves. This identity is not limited to religion but encompasses all concepts related to the divine, philosophical, ancient traditions, meditation, and prayer. Many things can be considered here.

In our modern world, we lack surrender, softness and a chance to put down all the pressures of life—the spiritual identity reflects your perspective on this critical part of life. This can encompass everything from **"Universe's Child"** to **"Sacred Activist"** to **"Mystical Healer."**

**Leigh Ann Would Say...**

> "The next one is **Spiritual**. So we really recommend that everyone consider an identity in all of the different categories. And if you don't have one, it's okay. But also know that, like, that's your biggest chance to kind of up level your life, like, where you have resistance, or whatever... And if you don't have one, all good. And if you do, it also doesn't have to be religious, right? Like, it can be, whoo, it can be, like, I did this work, this thing with a bunch of Russians, and they, like, just so easily, were like, 'Oh, I'm Universe's Child'."

Some clients immediately resonate with spiritual identities while others experience resistance or uncertainty. The coach should normalize both responses while encouraging exploration of what provides meaning and connection in the client's life. Sometimes the spiritual identity emerges through other categories, such as viewing their "Mother" or "Healer" role as fundamentally spiritual.

The language used for spiritual identities often requires particular attention to find terms that feel authentic rather than borrowed or imposed. Clients should be encouraged to explore all possibilities—whether traditional religious terminology, unconventional expressions, philosophical concepts, or ancient wisdom traditions—to find what matches their actual experience and opens them to connection with something greater.

## 6. Physical Expression and Health

This category encompasses the client's relationship with their body, health practices, and physical capabilities. It might include identities like **"Bio-Hacker,"** **"Intuitive Athlete,"** **"Holistic Level Up Huntress,"** or **"Embodied Wellness Guide."**

**Leigh Ann Would Say...**

> "Okay, **Physical Expression/Health**. So this is like, this is your Bio-Hacker, although you put it in your other thing, it could also be here. This is also Athlete. Like everyone kind of manifests differently in this way, like, what is your Physical Expression? And maybe it is the Bio-Hacker. Maybe it's some sort of, maybe it's some sort of other thing, but it's kind of like, how do you physically show up in the world, and how do you care for and relate to your body as, you know, different than the physical appearance, which is kind of like your presentation to the world. This is kind of your relationship with your body itself and your maintenance of it."

The coaching exploration should distinguish between appearance-focused and health-focused energies, as these often serve different functions. While Personal Appearance addresses external presentation, Physical Expression relates to internal vitality, strength, and bodily awareness.

Some clients naturally excel in this area while others experience resistance or avoidance. The coach should help identify what aspects of physical health feel most inspiring and sustainable for the individual, avoiding one-size-fits-all approaches to wellness and fitness.

## 7. Familial Relations

This category addresses how clients show up in family relationships, whether biological, chosen, or symbolic. The identity might be literal, such as **"Mother,"** **"Sister,"** or **"Daughter,"** or more archetypal, such as **"Family Anchor"** or **"Generational Healer."**

**Leigh Ann Would Say...**

> "So this one, actually, I - obviously you have a bunch of these, so this one's **Familial Relation**. So you have mom, or you have, in, I heard you do three of them, like Mom, Sister and Daughter, right? And so, you know, you're obviously someone who has very strong family ties, which is beautiful. And so you get to decide if you want to have multiple Identities for family if, you know, you want to choose one for the sake of like, 'this embodies how I relate to everyone'. Maybe it's Sister, maybe it's Mother, maybe it's you know you or if you say, like, look, 'I'm Mother', 'I'm a Mother and a Daughter and those are both important for me'."

Clients with strong family connections might identify multiple familial identities, but the coach should explore with them if there is one energy that encompasses all. If not, they can absolutely have more in this area. Most people will find one sufficient but some may choose mother and daughter etc. because both roles are significant in their life. Sometimes a single identity like **"Sister"** can encompass how someone wants to relate to parents, siblings, children, and extended family members.

For clients with complicated family relationships, this category might initially produce resistance. The coach can explore symbolic or aspirational approaches, such as becoming the **"Mother"** to their inner child or choosing **"Wise Elder"** energy regardless of chronological age.

---

## 8. Romantic and Sexual Expression

This category encompasses intimate partnership, sexuality, and romantic energy. Common examples include **"Princess Wife,"** **"Sacred Lover,"** **"Playful Partner,"** or **"Divine Masculine/Feminine."** The identity should reflect how the client wants to show up in intimate relationships rather than how they currently behave.

**Leigh Ann Would Say...**

> "So the next one is **Romantic Relation** and or **Sexual Expression**... so I'll tell you that like Lover, we've played around with. Lover is kind of the standard, right? And then I kind of was like hopping around on all these things, and at this current moment, it's Princess Wife."

Some clients feel immediate clarity about their romantic identity while others experience uncertainty, struggle, or pain in this area of their life. Single clients might explore what kind of partner energy they want to cultivate, while coupled clients might consider how to capture and define the kind of relationship they want to have.

The coach should create safety for exploring this often vulnerable territory while maintaining appropriate boundaries.

---

## 9. Doer of Things

The final category addresses getting things done and handling life's practical necessities. This identity handles the practical aspects of bringing visions into reality and maintaining daily life responsibilities. Examples might include **"Captain of My Life,"** **"Efficient Implementer,"** or **"Graceful Administrator."**

**Leigh Ann Would Say...**

> "And now, the last one is the **Doer of Things**. We all have stuff we have to do—pay the mortgage, go to the grocery store, register your car, go to the dentist. Action is a huge part of life, and there are all sorts of actions that we have to take that aren't necessarily about our passions and dreams, but they can still be a self-validating, self-fulfilling action. So it's important to choose the name of your Doer of Things so that it becomes an elevating experience. Not like 'a dishwasher' or 'a slave'—it's a self-validating, self-affirming action that you do. You can make going to the DMV a self-fulfilling practice, as opposed to some horrible thing that you have to do that you hate. Mine is **Captain of My Life**—I take care of all my duties swiftly and with honor in order to have smooth seas in my life."

Most people struggle with completion functions, so it's important to give them this identity to empower them. The coach's challenge involves helping clients find language that feels empowering rather than burdensome for their executive function. Examples that have resonated include **"Problem Solver,"** **"The Driver"** (chosen by someone who said "I've been a passenger forever!"), and **"Successful Doer."**

The coach's challenge involves helping clients find language that feels empowering rather than burdensome for their executive function. The identity should acknowledge the importance of this capacity while preventing it from overshadowing other aspects of the person.
