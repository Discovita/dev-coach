# Introduction to Dev Coach

Welcome to the Dev Coach documentation! Dev Coach is a sophisticated life coaching chatbot system developed by Discovita that helps users create and maintain multiple identities for different areas of their lives.

## What is Dev Coach?

Dev Coach is an AI-powered life coaching system that guides users through a structured process of creating and maintaining multiple identities. Each identity represents a different aspect of the user's life (career, relationships, health, etc.) and helps them achieve their goals more effectively.

## How It Works

The Coach system operates through several key phases:

1. **Initial Assessment** - Understanding the user's current situation and goals
2. **Identity Creation** - Helping users create specific identities for different life areas
3. **Goal Setting** - Establishing clear objectives for each identity
4. **Daily Practice** - Supporting users in living out their identities
5. **Progress Tracking** - Monitoring growth and adjusting strategies

## Core Systems

Dev Coach is built on several interconnected systems:

- **Prompt Manager System** - Manages the AI prompts used for different coaching phases
- **Action Handler System** - Processes and executes actions based on user interactions
- **Coach State Management** - Tracks user progress and current coaching phase
- **Identity Management** - Stores and manages user-created identities

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Django Rest Framework with Python
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **AI**: Integration with various AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
