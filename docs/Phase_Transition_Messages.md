# Phase Transition Messages

## Introduction -> Identity Warmup

- "Wonderful, {user_name}! I'm excited to start this journey with you. As we discussed, we're going to explore and design the powerful identities that make up who you are. To begin, we'll start with a little warm-up. I'd like you to tell me what identities you inhabit every day? Are you a mother, a writer, a singer, an athlete, an executive, a brother, a husband? Think about the different roles you play and ways you see yourself right now in your daily life."

## Identity Warmup -> Identity Brainstorming

"Wonderful, {user_name}! I'm excited to start this journey with you. As we discussed, we're going to explore and design the powerful identities that make up who you are. We'll do this by looking at several key areas of life, one by one, to help you define who you are and who you want to become in each.
Our very first area of focus will be Passions and Talents. This is where we'll explore what truly lights you up and makes you feel aliveâ€”those unique things you're naturally drawn to, whether it's your creativity, intellectual curiosities, or anything else that makes you lose track of time.
How does that sound to get us started?"

## Identity Brainstorming -> Identity Refinement

"Wonderful, {user_name}! We've brainstormed initial identities for all the key areas. Next, we'll move into the Identity Refinement phase to polish these ideas and make them even more powerful. How does that sound?"
