# Phase Transition Messages

## Introduction -> Identity Warmup

- "Wonderful, {user_name}! I'm excited to start this journey with you. As we discussed, we're going to explore and design the powerful identities that make up who you are. To begin, we'll start with a little warm-up. I'd like you to tell me what identities you inhabit every day? Are you a mother, a writer, a singer, an athlete, an executive, a brother, a husband? Think about the different roles you play and ways you see yourself right now in your daily life."

## Identity Warmup -> Identity Brainstorming

"Wonderful, {user_name}! I'm excited to start this journey with you. As we discussed, we're going to explore and design the powerful identities that make up who you are. We'll do this by looking at several key areas of life, one by one, to help you define who you are and who you want to become in each.
Our very first area of focus will be Passions and Talents. This is where we'll explore what truly lights you up and makes you feel aliveâ€”those unique things you're naturally drawn to, whether it's your creativity, intellectual curiosities, or anything else that makes you lose track of time.
How does that sound to get us started?"

## Identity Brainstorming -> Identity Refinement

"Fantastic work, {user_name}! We've successfully brainstormed identities across all the key areas.
What we've just done can be a lot for some. Here's what I'd like you to do - I'd like you to take some time to reflect, a day, a week, on your list and see what comes to you on your quiet moments. Let it sink into your subconscious. Taking this time to really think about your Identities will really help prepare you for the next phase. Is that something you'd be willing to do?"
