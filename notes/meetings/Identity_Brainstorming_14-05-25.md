Hi, hi,
how are you sorry
to keep you up at all hours? No, not at all.
It's not, it's actually, it's only nine o'clock here, so it's not like, super late and it's this place is really weird. The time zone that I live in, like, goes from like, Berlin all the way across, so, like, it's, it's still daylight outside. It's like, what it's like? Looks like you're 630 Oh, wow. Really weird. I actually hate it. I like, I like, like, for me, nine o'clock, it's supposed to be, like, dark outside. Like, yeah,
wow,
summer, you know, yeah. Okay, so I'm just like, in there, and I'm like, Okay, I see the problem, but I don't really have, like, enough experience to structure a solution.
Yeah, yeah. I got you. So, okay, so, okay, so you probably had a bunch of no
no. So just, I think that I want to, I just want some coaching and encouragement before I, like, just hack a bunch of things apart, because, again, I can spot the error, but I actually don't know what the solution is,
yeah, okay. Well, that, no, that's fine. It's so I will say that the solution for this, getting the getting the bot to do what you want, what you're wanting right now with prompting only is going to be difficult. That's not an easy thing to that's actually one of the things these big companies like, I work, I work for trilogy, and they have been trying to figure this out for a very long time. Like, how to do these long form conversations where it remembers all of the stuff, and it can transition to between all these different because they're they do, like, education, right? So it's all the same thing. Like, how do you teach a lesson this way, right? And so how do you go from the different stages? How do you do all this stuff so nobody's figured it out. It's, nobody's an expert at it because of the head, then you would see these things all over the place, and you don't, which means nobody's figured it out yet. But I think we have a good, a pretty dang good solution so far. Just have to dial it in and get it to get it working, really so, so I'm saying that to say the bot is not going to do the identity brainstorming thing 100% the way that you want, until we make changes in the back end, and until we change the context keys and say, okay, here is what you're supposed to be doing. These are like, we'll have to change. So I was looking, I've got the code open, so sorry if I have two screens. So if I'm not looking, my camera's right here. I have a screen here and a screen here. And so sometimes, I mean, like, all your things. So what I was doing is I was looking at, yes, I was looking at the identity or the coach. The coach states that I'm going to change the name, I'm going to call them coach phases. So when we go from introduction to identity brainstorming to all of the all of the different ones, to me, those are going to be phases. And then the coach state is going to be the state of your conversation, like, where you are, what you've completed, your checklist of things you've done and haven't done, and where you've like, where you pick up, how you pick up, where you left off, kind of thing. That's just getting my own little nomenclature. So from now on, that makes more sense.
Okay, so the coach phase for the identity brainstorming thing. It needs to be the right way to do it is to write these, add in these different, these parameters. And I think I'm probably going to just be explicit about it and just write like, it doesn't, like, who cares? It's just a database entry. And so we can have a million things on there. It's just for this so, and we're not worried about like, we could refactor it later if we really need to. But the coach state is just like, I'm looking at it like the checklist of, like, have you done this? Where are you at? Kind of thing? So you can have essentially an item on there for every single one of these. So for each identity category, you would go in and you would add, you would say, you know, here's the, here's the identity that we came up with, right? And you would just link directly. So come it would come, I know you don't, yeah, but you would just link directly out of the identities table, which identity was created for that one. Here it is, right? And if they don't have it, if there's no identity for that, I can fix it so that when you construct the prompt and you provide the context, you can say the user has created the identity, and then it goes and pulls the description and the notes and stuff for that particular identity and says, Hey, here's what the user's done so far. We've done, you know, we've done the first three, and you can see that the fourth one is empty. And so of course, that would be where you would need to pick up, where you left off, right. And it'll have the context for the conversation, and it should be able to, llms are good at that stuff. Okay,
yeah? Because, well, I also saw in there, like, I gave you a giant diatribe of all the things I saw that was great. I was actually,
I was watching it. I made it about three quarters of the way through it, and before we got on the call, yeah, got a
little call, perfect. So I was like, I'll just put this down, because obviously, like, because the thing was, I'm like, okay, all these things once you've made just three, like, that's wrong, but I don't know if, like, removing it is the answer right. Because, like, you said, there's infrastructure that you have to create so that the prompts matter. And so I think that let me like so ones like that. And also this other idea, which you guys haven't done yet, which I think that like we should do together is we should do another session on your identities, and like do your IMS, so that you'll see the difference. Because right now what we did is we just came up with the word right. So, Father, this pianist, right? So we just came up with the word. That's our only goal with the like identity brainstorming is to come up with one word for each category, or have the client cognizantly skip a category. Yeah, the only reason you would skip is because you're like, This is too big of a mouthful for me to chew. I'm not ready. Yeah,
yeah. I'm not
ready for this mutual question. I'm not ready for the family one. We'll move on. And so we're trying to get this list. That's the only goal. And there's a bunch of stuff in here that's like, make an I am statement, and that is a later phase. Like, we're literally just very first Yes. So I basically gave you everything that I think, and I did a couple of other, sorry, I'm clicking around, and then I lose you. I did a couple of other, like, I was like, this, I'm just going to remove but like, I kind of know that, like, removing it isn't the answer. It, like, needs to be replaced with something. Yeah,
yeah. Here's what I think I can do. If you think, if so, I will say I didn't. I have not messed with this is my first so I've been working, I've been working on this for I don't know how long, but this is my very first time actually touching the prompts. Never touched the prompts up until this point, so everything has just been replicating and building things. So I'm decent at it. I'm actually I'm pretty good at the prompt engineering side and kind of getting it to do what it needs to do. I know exactly, like, I can look at those prompts, I know exactly why Jake put all of those things in there. I know, like, I can tell you why it's in there. Just a whole like, there's reasons, right, right? I completely agree with you, though. So Jake wrote a chat bot does much better if it knows what it's doing and why. So if you say, here's what you're doing and here's why you're doing it, that's the thing that people don't, most people don't put in the why part, right? Which is what that whole system context thing is, it's like explaining what this even is, what, what you are a chat bot. But, okay, but why? Like, where do you fit? Like, what's the whole, what's the big picture kind of thing, and that's what that system context is supposed to be. And then later, he says, Now here are the specific instructions for where you are in this big picture, right? So that's what all. That's it. But one of the things, and this is just kind of figure this out by testing it, which is, we're figuring it out now, I think you're probably right that if you're if you are dividing up your conversation into different phases, you probably don't want to bleed across phases very much.
Yeah, even in this context, because it's going to confuse because I was getting a lot of answers that were incorrect, because I was like, Oh, it's just going nuts. It's trying to do it all at once. But I realized why it's trying to do it all at once, because he has all those right,
all written down. It's
also his understanding of what he thought it was supposed to do, not my understanding. And so I can see the errant instructions, but I can also see the structure of the instructions, and I don't actually know what to put in structurally to make it correct. So I don't know, just want to, you know, knock around with the things that I've given, but I just would love some feedback of, like, what you think to do, or if I asked Jay, like, I'm also down to, like, we get whatever infrastructure you want to do on the back end. And then I say to Jake, okay, these are the specific because I think he's, you know, he has that great, like, mathematically simplistic
kind of Jake is great for that stuff, for sure. Yeah, I think that what I
might want to do is, why don't you do the back end that you think we need to do to, like, get it to the point where prompts can help, to help, help us, and then I can say to him, all right, these are the errors. Because what I want, I actually want someone to teach me the logic. That's why I'm calling you, right? Yes, I want someone to teach me the logic of how I fix it, because I can see the error, but I don't actually know what to do to fix it, but I think I could learn and so maybe, yeah, so I think that I could ask him if you want to just work on what you think you need to do on the back side to make it functional. And then I can call him and be like, Okay, we're doing this thing, but I see these errors in the prompts, and I want to know how you would fix them. Yeah,
absolutely. I think that's, that's great. Yeah, I don't see any issues with that at all,
because he's the one who's writing all this prompt stuff, right? Yes.
So I, I don't want to say, I don't I don't want to speak. I don't want to speak for Jake. I don't know I, spoke with Jake. I kind of just sent him a thing, like, Hey, I built this, I built that. I put a bunch of other stuff in in a new repo, just kind of letting him know, like, hey, I need this stuff like this. I didn't want him to anyway, but the message I got back was kind of like, he didn't seem like he was gonna, like, even be here anymore, like, I don't know,
okay, yeah, but he had said to me, Look, I'm available for consultation. I'm available for this. But, yeah,
he didn't say that he wouldn't turn on his clock. Yeah, he didn't like, he didn't say that he wouldn't, you know, quote, unquote, turn on his clock. But it seemed to me like I can get, I can get, I can just give you the messages that he sent me, but
the No, I'll just him directly. I don't think it. I don't think I need to, okay, yeah, I don't want
to, like, I don't know, I don't know what's going on with him personally. I don't, I haven't, I haven't spoken with him, and I don't have that kind of a relationship with him. I wish I did. He's a super cool dude, but we didn't really work long enough together to kind of get that far. You know how dudes are dudes? They're kind of like, anyway, yeah, yeah, so. But I think he's got some stuff going on, and he's kind of doing, like, I don't know. It seems he's got a bunch of changes. You can tell he's got a bunch of stuff going on. He's making some life changes, and he's kind of trying to figure out what he wants. And I think that he told me in this basically, the gist was he's like, I took this on, and I wasn't really in the head space for it. And he's like, so he's like, basically the message was,
do as you will well,
though it's yeah, he's like, don't let me stop you from doing anything. And I'm happy at what you built, but I'm not going to look at it unless Leigh Ann pays me to look at it, or if you need something, if you need me to look at it for something, then I'll go look at it. But other than that, like, he's like, it was almost like, why are you telling me about
this? Okay, great. Well, I'm going to ask him. I'm going to ask him to teach me how to fix the prompts that I think aren't, that I know aren't correct, but I don't actually know how to structure.
I can tell you, I can give you, I can give you a bunch of hints. So there's a bunch of stuff. I can go back and cover some stuff right now, if you want. Okay, sure. Okay, so wanted me
to just go down the line and kind of repeat my loom video, yeah. And
then we can go, we can go through and talk about how each one of those things, how I would fix them, may have different, you know, he may have different.
Well, I'm down to here more, you know, like, more over less. Okay, let me just figure out how to share this screen way we can look at it.
Sorry, no, it's all it just that way. Okay, yeah, okay,
duh. Okay, so I had changed this to 10, because before it had said three, and again, I'm like, not sure if that's the right answer,
yes. Okay, so here's how I this, this particular issue that you had. The way, the way that this problem will get fixed is the whole concept of this, this identity brainstorming prompt, is going to get shifted, and it's going to get shifted to get shifted to focusing on one identity, like, your job is to do this identity. This is what you're doing right now. This is all you have to do, right? So it's not going to be generate 10, it's not going to be generate even one. It's just going to be like, your job is to make sure that all these identities got created. They're not all created yet. We're on this one, right? And then, and then say, Here you go, like, and then that's kind of how so you're going to
build in the back end. Then what do we do with this? We just get rid of it and delete that prompt.
That prompt will get completely rewritten based off that new context. Once that, once you have that new context, the the way you write the prompt is different, because now you have new information that
the currently you would go in and rewrite it. Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, the Yes. So if I with this new context, would come a new prompt, right? I would write your prompt for you, but that's
not, but that's what I'm this is what I'm trying to figure out, because I don't
know. Okay, yeah, okay, let me make sure I'm not going to give you, yeah, I Okay, maybe also I, I didn't. I don't want you to feel like that, like, I gave you this thing and it's like, Okay, have fun figuring out your prompts. Like, I don't want it to feel like that at all. I just wanted the whole point in this whole thing was that, well, yeah, transparency so you can see, like, there, none of this stuff is hidden behind the curtain anymore. You can see exactly what's going on, and you can edit it yourself, right? If you're like, I don't like this. This sucks. Rip it out, save for a new version. I'm getting rid of this, like, bye, bye. And just say, hey guys. I updated the prompts Right, right?
And then I think I'm a little bit training wheels. I need a little bit of training wheels. Yeah,
there's nothing wrong with that at all. Jump
in, because, like I said, I definitely saw problems, but didn't I didn't know that I had the solutions. Yeah. So before you change this thing, this number one and two are correct, because these are things that are not in the prompt state, or maybe it is. It's like, right now you're just working on current identities. Right now you're working on aspirational identities. Then you reflect them. Is there anything missing? Confirm, okay, reflection.
One thing I'm seeing real quickly is that, like that reflection thing, where it says, Okay, after they share both lists, right? That that could almost be another coaching phase. So like one phase would be the identity brainstorming, where you come up with all your lists, and you make it through the checklist. The second you've made it through the checklist, you go to a new phase, and that whole reflection thing is a whole separate phase that you insert into the into the thing. It has its own prompt and its own thing.
Okay, got you so that's one of the things that I was thinking about. Is like, basically these reflections, and this is how I would build it, if I mean, and I don't know if it works for you, but I think that these reflections are something that we can insert. Like, there's going to be a lot of them, because, like I said in my video, like, we need to make this very digestible bites, or people can blow through it and be like, No, I'm going to just keep going, you know? But basically, yeah, it would be once you did who, who are you and who do you want to be? That's basically it. You can go around and just kind of think about that for a few days, or a day or an hour or 15 minutes, yeah, and then you can come back, and then you get into the categories, but, but essentially, there are some very natural breaks in the process, right? What we did with you was we did, who are you, who do you want to be, and identity categories, and then we broke, yeah, that's kind of how it takes. Ann, I mean, it took us way longer than that, yeah,
but,
but that's kind of a once you do. You could do the first amount and just let people think about it, then they could come back, they could do the categories and then let people think about it. And you could also, like, let people think about it after each category. I mean, yeah, you
could say, like, there could be, like, a whole, like, one day you go in and you make a one of your identities, right? Like, you know, you do one of your I Am identities, right? And then the next day you do another one. And you kind of just, like, work your way through the checklist, right? And then once you've gotten them
all done, you and I think that's kind of the thing about this process, is like it should, you should be able to choose, since it's a virtual coach, you don't need to, like, schedule time and sit down with someone. You could do it completely at your own pace. So there is something interesting about how we would do the reflection breaks. And I don't think that it's critical to the process. I think we should build the process and make sure that the process works smoothly, all in one flow, if possible, and then we can kind of go back and implement them, unless you think that's a bad idea, no,
whatever. So that's, this is the part of the part of it where as far as far as a technical standpoint goes, you can do these reflection breaks whenever, whenever, right? We can build the however, whatever, the best way to do it is, right. So like, if, let's say, I'm seeing this prompt, is going to morph into focusing on creating a single identity. So, and I think it's, you're gonna get what, much better results out of this thing, because it's just gonna stay in this loop over and over again, and it'll, it'll make it'll work its way. It'll work its way down the checklist, basically, of saying, Okay, here's where we are. You've got that one great. We've added that one in, and then now we're gonna move on to the next one. And it's just gonna use that kind of same prompt and kind of go through that same thing, but at the end of it, you could have, you could as part of that prompt, you could put in a reflection break on that one identity, right? So that could just be part of the conversation that you have, like, hey, take a break and think about it. Or ask them if they want to take a break and think about it, right? Just be like, Hey, do you want a break here after we did it? Or, I think
that's kind of the thing we actually want to offer. And I think this would also be something that would be helpful in when we talked about the onboarding Chat, where it's like, how are you going to sit down and do this? Is this like a five minute a day project for you? Or do you want to sit down? Yeah, bust through it as quickly as possible. Because if it's someone who's like, I have five minutes a day for this, then we're going to give them a break after every single one. If it's someone that says, No, I want to do this, like, I want to get through it as fast as I can, then we do it every hour. You know, we do it after every like, major state. So I think it can be flexible. I mean, I don't know. I can see you trying to figure out how to do that technically, but I think that that it does have the opportunity to be flexible to the user's
needs. Yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely. I
think the reflection break, it's like, super easy. How many do we have in there? It just kind of based on, you know, whatever data. What's much more difficult is to get the coach
to do what we want. So I think, actually, you know what? One of the I actually just thought about a really slick way to do it. What you could do is just as part of, like the regular system prompt for every time, whenever the bot is talking, just every it is part of the system message. You say something like, you keep track in the database of when the last time they took a reflection break. You just log, you know, whatever the date and time was, and then you just include that and what the current date and time is inside of the chat bot, right? You just give it here's the last time they took a break, and here's the current one. And then you change some sort of variable based off of their their onboarding process for how often they might want to take breaks. And so whatever that is, you just say, hey, every you know, so and so, you know, if this amount of time has been exceeded, or whatever, you can calculate all that and pass it in and just say, hey, it's been, actually, you don't even need to do that. You just tell the chat bot you do the calculations, and you say, it's been, you know, five hours since the last time they took a reflection break, right? And it would be in chat hours, right? Right? Or whatever it would be an hour in,
yeah, yeah. Well, that's one way. But actually, the problem is, is that there are critical moments that are opportune for breaks, and we wouldn't want it to stop in the middle of, like, the positive flow of information.
Yeah, we, I think so that's where the prompting part comes in. I don't think, I don't think you would have a problem with
that. It would, I think that this is not, I think it I get for you how you're kind of trying to figure out how to make it work, and I think that we can, but I don't think it's the most important problem that we need to work on. It's a very not important problem. The much bigger problem is like getting it to do what we want it to do. So like, let's focus on that first, and then we can implement some sort of a recess option later,
yeah, like I said, I don't think that that can be like, a little layer that you add on top later on, but I don't think we'll interfere with with the way that the coach will work. And you can get it to do it as often as as you want, right? And then you can even, like, one way you could do it is just be like at the end, just have to say, do a double check and make sure that they don't need a reflection break at this point, right? And just just to check, right? Be like, Hey, just like, kind of re trigger it or something. I
think it double A double check would be great.
Okay, all right.
Well, then, yeah,
sorry, I wanted to look at, oh, that's not the right thing at all. Yeah, there we go. Okay, I want to look at the identity
categories.
Identity categories. Okay, so there are 123, I have nine of them. Is that right? I think that sounds right. No, so
it's not correct. That was one thing that I was, uh, noticing in that. Okay, so it ends at familial relation. It's missing romantic relation and DOER of things.
Okay, yeah. So though I have these, those are in my code, so I have nine total in my code. So okay, obviously, doesn't match up with the prompt, right. Okay,
right, right, right. But
again, this, the whole, this whole fundamental thing would change, like, this list wouldn't even exist. This list would be taken out and managed in the database. And it would be like, imagine, like a checklist, and be like, boop, yes, yes, no, yes, no. Okay, so
I don't need to mess with that. Yes.
I don't know what the goal, the
goals. So again, all what I did, what you currently have, is replica, is replicated what we already had. I didn't take anything out. I didn't add anything. I just took what we made and put it into a new thing. So there were goals before in all these prompts, I left them all in there because I didn't want to, I didn't want to touch but, but
you know what they are? No, no.
I don't know what they are. But again, I hadn't. I had to rely on what Jake said, or what Jake had written down and all the prompts, and he probably wrote them down at some point as it's yeah, if they don't need to be there, I will pull them out. I'll actually write a to do so that I can. I'll just rip the goals out, because
I don't actually even know what they refer to. That's what I'm user, no, that's
good. It's good that you said that. Because I don't, I didn't know either, and I was having a hard time, like, for the other stuff, I could connect it. But these goals were kind of just like floating. And I was like, shit. Okay, good, okay, good, yeah, well,
that question, they're not right, yeah,
those are easy to that's just easy to pull out, not to do it all. Could actually simplify your app
ask open ended questions. Okay, so again, once they have three identities, so this thing again, this is probably going to get changed based on, we're just doing one at a time,
right? Yeah, okay, I could tell I just had a, I just had a an epiphany for something that, that what you might ought to do, or what you could do if you wanted to work on it.
Make myself useful.
Well, yeah, don't, yeah, please don't. Let me tell you what to do, right? I guess the best way to say it would be, anyway, the way you could do is write a prompt, using this as a guide, that where you see all the mistakes. Just fix it. Be like, Okay, this is just write down exactly what you said. You know how it works. You're the expert on the commission, right? So and use, use your dictation on the, on the, on your computer, right command or hit control two times and just dictate to the thing, right? So you don't even have to type it out. So you can just that's another thing too. You can just brain dump this stuff, then give it to Claude and say, I need this to be a prompt. And here's the context for my prompt, or whatever, and then it'll give it to you, but get it to focus on just the single process, the the process for honing one identity category, that's right, or one category, yeah, that's right. That's what this is going to get turned into eventually. Right? To do that, and we're going to give it the context of saying, Here's your checklist, and now we're going to go through and we're going to follow this.
One of the things I mentioned was it obviously needs context about, like, what each category represents. I think that I've sent that already, but I need to
probably I have all of the old code. So the there were, there's lots of notes. Jake has lots and lots of notes. So that's good. Oh no. Oh sorry. Okay, so here's one, one thing you can do is you could just, you could fake that data. I'll show you here. I'll just show you so identity brainstorming here. Leigh, this, I'm going to, I'm
going to say this as a new version.
Okay, so I have brain three blah, blah, yes, I don't. Okay, yeah, okay. So like one of the things, one of the things that like immediately I notice on here is that it says the very first thing. It says, explain the purpose of identity brainstorming. It's not written down anywhere on this prompt what identity brainstorming is. Doesn't say, like, how does this bot know what it is, unless it comes from the system context, which
probably gonna we'll probably pull that out anyways. Okay, add
the client explorer, both current and aspirational identities. Okay, so when the when we do, okay, let me make sure I understand something when we Yeah, so we do, okay, so we're gonna have, we do the identity categories twice, is that, right? What
do you mean? We do them well,
so we go through them twice, we do them for the current identities, and then we do them for
so, so here's, here's actually the flow. It's just like it's kind of considered a warm up for the workout, right? Yeah, who are you and who do you want to be? So, like, first it's like, Who do you already know you are? And then it's kind of like, well, why are we here? We're not here because we want to Okay, okay, so this is the warm up, and you kind of have this list, and it exists in the background, but the exercise, the real workout, is going through each category. Okay, your original list to fill to be like, okay, passions and talents. You're like, Okay, well, pianist is one, engineer is another, this, whatever. And then obviously you can refer back to your first list and be like, Well, my my family relation is father, and you can refer back to your list as husband, right? So these are all things to just kind of open your pathways of thinking about it, yeah. And then you can use them to complete the exercise again. But once we go through each category, once you're done with that exercise, and then you should have your list of your kind of basic identities that you've nailed down in each area. And I think, like the real, the value is kind of explaining what each category is, again, so that the mind can open, the mind can bloom, and choose something relevant to them in each category. That's probably what's unique about each one, right? And then, and then, once that's done, you kind of have these names, and you're done with the identity brainstorming category, then you move on to what it says in here, identity refinement, and where it's like, okay, you're a father, but like, is that it? Or you want to be like, an engaged father? You want to be a whatever. Sometimes poke and prompt that you poke the user to, like, really level up their kind of conception of themselves in this area, we started with dad. But what do we really want to be? What actually, like fires you up and gets you excited is, like, No, I want to be like an amazing dad, or I want to be an engaged dad, or I want to be a present or I want to be a pianist, or I want to be, you know, whatever it is if you need to get a juicier name, that would be refinement. Then refinement is done. You have the like, super inspiring names of all of your identities. Then we move on to I am creation. Then you write a statement, a sentence about yourself. I am an engaged father. I spend time with my kids, and I prioritize our connection over work, yeah, like, whatever your I Am, statement is, we haven't done those for you, but, but then when you're sitting at your desk, or, like, Dad,
I'm leaving, you know what I mean? So like, become these sort of like purposeful directive statements that help you choose how to take action in your life now to create the reality that you want in the future. So the the identity create brainstorming phase is truly that we're just brainstorming so that you nail something down in each category, and the refinement is making it really cool. And then the next one is, I am statements, okay, and so those are the next phases, okay,
all right, so, okay, all right. Now things are, things are congealing, okay, so
I feel like we are both. It's really funny. We are communicating about this, like, central thing. And I have all this knowledge on one side, and you have all this knowledge on the other. We have so many gaps,
yeah, we have to, like, fill them in, yeah,
that we keep, like, it's Color by Number. And we're starting to like, yeah, the gaps on each side of the fence. And eventually it's become one beautiful, you know, picture,
yeah, okay, so we don't need to, okay. So this, this, yeah, okay, so this whole thing where, this is okay. At the end,
we get into the weeds with the prompt where I'm like, I don't this isn't even right because, yeah, so
that's something I'm looking at right now. So based on, okay, based on what you just told me, this identity brainstorming prompt is like, it takes it way too seriously. I don't know if that's like, the right thing to say, but it's like this. It doesn't need to be like, that serious right now, or just like,
No, yeah, okay. Is it needs more context on what, what each category represents. It needs a little bit more or less. It needs less instructions, yeah,
let me Yeah. No, it needs much less. Man, yeah, you don't need all this stuff in here for what you just said, like, we don't need all of that stuff and this thing in here about, like, accepting identities and all that stuff. So there's code in here. One of my first assignments for Jake was to write code that if the chat bot wanted to, wanted to accept an identity, that you would get positive feedback from the user, yeah? Like, pull up this little button that says,
need that until identity refinement, that would actually be help.
That would be where you do that. Yeah. Okay, so this is just like, it's
like, fine in the beginning, and then it just goes, like, into the weeds, and it's just not, just not necessary. So he says, like, why don't you build your thing that you're going to build? And then we kind of go back to the drawing board, because I feel like some of this stuff is helpful, but some of it is just not,
yeah. I think I Yeah. I really think that the best way, so, yeah, the best way to move forward, I think, would be, yeah, you're not gonna like it. I think you're probably right. It's not gonna do what you want unless it knows what, which identities you created, and which ones you haven't. And until we build, until we put that in there, we can so what we can do in the meantime, before we do all of that stuff, is we can say you could just write like a thing, like put a I can hear, I have a version three.
 I have version three. I'll mess with it real quick. I'm actually, I'm just going to delete this loop. Okay, so I'll keep this. That's fine. Okay, I'm just going to delete basically almost everything loca,
yeah, why don't you delete every Why don't you delete everything that you think? Because I'm obviously like, I should just, yeah, but then I could maybe try to So
here's, here's the this. The whole reason this exists is that we can, I can write something in here, so we can set we could pretend, right? So I can just say, I can just say, I can just say something. I'm just going to type this out, Ann, if you want to, I don't know if you here, if you want, I'll share my screen. If not, then I'll just type quickly, and we'll see, hang on. So we'll just say, I'm just going to say something like identity, identity context. And then I'll just going to make up this thing. I'm just going to copy this right here loop.
Oh, no, wrong thing. Okay, so,
and I'll just say I'm just going to make up some stuff. You can change these to be whatever you want. I'm just typing in things, the keeper of money, and
just some, like, placeholder instructions, or even if you say, like, yeah,
right,
this is here, just so that I kind of look, I think that I can very well color within the lines. But, like, I don't know how to make the lines yet. Yeah, I don't know.
I want 100% you're, yeah, yeah. It's, it's not, you know what you're doing. You're doing what you're going to be doing, what, what people, even just a few years ago, couldn't do. You're going to be basically coding in natural language. I
know it's,
it's crazy. The world is going to be a crazy, crazy place. Okay, here, I bet you will get something, see, yeah, okay, this is how we're going to do this. Okay, so I'm
Yeah, and the thing is, so here's what we'll do, is we can, we can come up. This is actually much better. This is so much better because what you'll be able to do is now you'll be able to pass in specific instructions for each one of these identity categories, right? So if you have specific things that you want it to cover or talk about in these, you can easily just shove these into the prompt, right? And just say, you know, when you're talking about, you know, keeper of money. These are the things that you should talk about. Here's the things that you should say, right?
Just a little
examples. And since there's only nine of them, you could just have them all in one prompt, right? You don't need to have a whole bunch of different prompts and worry about transitioning state and all that stuff, and all that stuff, and just shut in there. And then it'll it. Should do it. I'm just gonna do I'm doing a
let's see how
my my question is, how long does it take to will it take to build the checklisty thing that you're referring to? Not
long. Okay, no, not long at all. Great.
But I can start working on once it's built this kind of like, these are all the parameters for the for the different identity categories.
Yeah, let's see. Trying to think of what. Let me look at my emails to Jake, that might be a good place to start.
See
okay, yeah, great,
I did it All on here, like, I
okay so?
And I'm saying now we're going to have to add an action for skipping, for skipping, in an identity,
yeah, because we need to be able to do that, because there are some that are just like too chocked full of issues for people to dress on the very first round. But when we get deeper into the work, it becomes much easier to address it once you unpacked more in your life. Yeah, and
keeping keeping track of that as part of the coach state will be great, because later on, you can add a phase in as part of the conversation where you go back and say, hey, you know I want to do we need to go back and look. Do you want to review the ones that you skipped here, the ones that you skipped kind
of deal when you finish this one part, you're kind of like, so now we're gonna, now that we've done this work, we go back and work on your identities again, because you know about your shadows, and it's much easier to, like, make decisions about your identities. And so you do a bunch of work again, and that's usually when you're like, Oh, I see that. I really need to create this one because, right, I have all this fucked up shit in my life, so Okay, let's do it
so
it's actually like, it's very nice. There's no having to force it, because it really does come full circle. Okay?
You know, I think maybe this was in our group chat.
Changes our lot.
Coach, this isn't admin.
Let's see. Okay, can you give me? Can you give me something like, when we talk about keeper of money, can you just give me, like, three little bullet points for things that?
Okay, so the things that I say for that is that you use very different energy in the world for making money and keeping money, and most people just think of it as one thing. So we want you to conceive of like an entire new identity for the keeping of your money, which is counting, organizing, investing, you know, assure you know these sorts of totally different behaviors. I know that that's like long winded, but whatever you extract from that, it's very different energy. And so you want, like, an identity that's making money, and then you want another identity that's sitting down and taking care of your money. Yeah, and just, and the thing about just thinking about this actually sometimes changes people's entire lives, just conceiving of it in this way
here, and this is another thing so we say something like this. I
Okay, and then so when they come up with the like, prompting them to come up with this identity, how would we say that? So like, do we just say like, I guess, yeah, you could just use, yeah, it's gonna be weird because there's gonna be like, notes. Why
don't you just write something that's notes to me, and I can go in and write it. So
the cool thing about our app is that I can save it on here, and you can immediately go look at it and edit it yourself. Yeah? So actually, I will let me save the changes, and then you can go look. You can go look at identity brainstorming version three, and you can see what I've written so far, right? And kind of like where my brain is going,
okay, so I just refresh. Oh,
just go to brainstorming. You're on refinement. Oh,
it should There you go. No,
that's not it. That should be it. Okay. You might have to actually refresh it. Oh, yeah, because it's updated in the database. But it probably is just using that's weird. I'm gonna have to look at that. That's weird how it says
not found. Yeah, you'll
have to, you'll have to delete the you have to delete prompts on the end or where it says, Test, I'll have to
fix that. Chat, no prompts. There you go.
And then in the identity brainstorming section should see,
there we go. Okay, great, that's, that's my stuff. That's what I've typed in. Great. So you can kind of see what I did, where I wrote, like, this little context thing up at the top that said I was going to put notes down the bottom. That's why there's that weird space there. Oh, yeah, so, yeah, that's so it's not done yet. Of course, I'm in the middle of, I'm in the middle of typing on it, but you can see identity. Context is, you can see that passions and talents is this one, maker of money is this one, and then the rest of them are just None, right? The idea being that it should know where you pick where you pick up, where you should pick up, right? Because it's like, okay, right? We can write on there, and it's, I just wrote on there. Your job is to walk the user through the brainstorming phase. You can't move to the next phase until you've got all nine categories have been addressed, either created an initial identity or skipped. And then you use the identity context above to determine which identity you should be focusing on right? And then wait. So here is where
I'll make a little speech of all my my little speeches that I make about each one, which I believe that I wrote this all for Jake somewhere, and I've just been digging around looking for it. I got it's
over here. Let me I can look at the Give me a second, and I can probably pull it up. I have a bunch of notes, but
this one says identity, context, pensions and talents, you're putting the actual one. That's yours. But that's not really what we want in the prompt, or it is no
so what they all this is what that is. So that's not going to be part of the final prompt. What that is is a stand in for what will be in the prompt. So it's that is the kind of information that you would get out of the database that would come from the database, and say, here's the user's current stuff. So all I'm doing is trying to mimic what would be coming out of the database. And then you can say, now that it has this context, let's see what it would do, right? If we, if we give it context that looks like that, I in reality, you'll have more information than that. You'll have because all the identities they'll have, if they've if it's written any notes or things like that, every time it, every time it, it has created an identity. For me so far, not to say that it'll keep doing this, but every time it's written an identity for me, it's always added a note that had something to do with the statement that I wrote down when I said I want to be like, if I want to be an engineer or whatever, it says something, it'll, it pulls something out of the conversation and writes a little note,
okay, and then later that, those should all be little tidbits for later, because they're actually not needed in this phase, but they are needed later,
yeah. Well, one of the I think that for those notes, maybe for this phase, even it will be, they'll be useful, because you might be able to use the notes that were written on other ones to enhance the conversation that you have about future identities that you're under. So I can be like, Hey, you said blah blah blah about being, you know, a mother, right? And so maybe that would, you know, I can lead it. Llms are super good at that stuff. It's actually really good at it, yeah.
So the more context that you can give to the bot about the actual user and what they've said before, right, right? It's going to be, it's going to be super good,
better. And that will actually be like, Okay, so we have identity brainstorming, identity refinement. I wonder if I need to make a flow chart of, like, what are all the phases that we in need to build? Yeah, that
might be a good idea. You could at least scaffold the stuff in the back end, at least. Because so far, this is all we've got. This is it's these three, right,
right? There's more. Well, especially, look, there's a really heavy lift in the beginning of creating the whole ecosystem, yeah, right, yeah. Then after that, all you're doing is interact, you know, drawing upon the ecosystem to encourage the user, right, right? And you're also refining the ecosystem. Because we grow, we change every year, every few months for a different person. So, like, things happen. So there is also referring back and refining the ecosystem. But the heavy lift in the beginning is the creation of it and getting through that. So I think that initially, like having a flow chart for that would be really good. Let me just
Yeah, I
am also like, it's really funny. I'm in this really interesting state, like, I went through like, such a stressful experience last week, of, like, moving out of this house and having to go, like, re expose myself to this like, environmental toxin for like, two or three days to get out. Yeah,
you didn't get sick again, did you? Oh,
yeah. I had a bunch of really weird stuff happening. I will spare you from the but I one of the things that was really good that happened was the the day that I knew I never had to go back in there, my resting heart rate dropped 10 beats per minute.
That's great.
And my 800 doubled. I mean, it's like, I mean, the the kind of overall wellness indicators, it's like, I mean, I was talking, I was at this Maha event, make America healthy again yesterday, that was all these wellness experts, like super famous ones, and I was talking to them about it, and you they're just faces. When I said, you know, like, my went down 10 beats per minute, my HRV doubled, like, and it's been consistent ever since my body knows I never need to go back. They were like, oh my god, yeah,
amazing, yeah.
And I've also been in this crazy, like, recoil, of like, we're like, naps and like, just not really, like, my body's in just like, full, low output at the moment, yeah,
yeah. Well, you're probably it's, it's tiring, right? You went through, you went through, like, two months or more of just like, super hectic, ultra stress,
yeah. And I think my body is just kind of in this, like, kind of bottom out phase, and I'm just going with it. Tomorrow's my birthday. Like, we
happy birthday.
We actually have a social event every single night this week, which is kind of crazy. So I'm kind of like, that's my life right now. I'm not gonna really about daytime things. So, yeah, there's a bunch of, like, we had this event last night. We have, there's a two night event today and tomorrow, and then another friend's birthday party on Friday. Someone just invited us to something cool Saturday.
So, right? We're just,
that's awesome. The
day is kind of like, I'm just kind of like dreaming through the day. So that's
awesome. Okay, you deserve it, because that's a big, yeah, that's, that's going to be like, a nice, I guess vacation is not the right word to say, yeah. It's
kind of a Yeah. That's what we've been saying, kind of like a vacation. So what was I saying that I was going to do for you? Because I was writing it down so I don't mess it up.
We were looking for, what you were doing is we were looking for, yeah, oh, that's right, yeah, yeah. That actually might be really helpful. Yeah,
I think so, because then you will also understand, I think part of the problem is that it kind of couldn't conceive of every what is required for this phase, what's required for that phase. And I'll make sure
that one thing I'm going to do also is I need to, I don't. So okay, so this is silly, a little bit, little bit of technical stuff, but not too much so on. Within these coding editors, you can add in context, right? So you can add in, like, one of the, one of the big problems with code editors, and AI helping you code is that it doesn't have the big picture of your whole application. It can only solve these, like, super narrow problems. And a lot of times, it'll solve your problem in a way that doesn't work with other parts of your app, because it just doesn't know, right? And that's the big that's it's getting better and better at it. But one of the ways that they're getting around that is they're allowing you to add in context. So you can say, you know, my app is built in this language, and I'm doing these things, and this is how I do stuff. And whenever I say, I want to do this, do it this way, and that kind of thing. And when you do apps like this, like you can get context for what these identity categories are. So I can have like, a document in here that would say, like, Okay, this is the coaching app. This is what we're building. This is the flow chart. This is where all these pieces fit in. This is how all this stuff works, right? And they can help you come up with solutions that work with all that stuff. So having, like, a big, like a basically, documentation for how the whole thing is going to work and how all these little pieces fit is would be, is going to be helpful, for sure.
So I'm pretty sure that I already did.
I'm pretty sure that I already did this for you guys, the kind of details and the flow of the conversation
you probably did.
I'm pretty sure that I already did, but you look around for it, I look around for it.
There's docs in here, for sure. Yeah,
I just, you know, my I I just have to see, because I try to keep everything right now I have all this, like, lawsuit stuff everywhere, so I had that in a different drive, so I try to keep it kind of out, okay, yeah, because I was looking in where I have, like, identity flow, I'm Looking at the dates too when I open these things,
yeah, these are, yeah, okay, I've seen these. I've seen these documents before.
Yeah, this, oh, okay, this one has it kind of, I mean, this one has, I think that I did a different one, this. This was the original one. Yeah, what excites you? What are you naturally drawn to? These things are these are the things make you unique, your creativity, your intellectual pursuits, the things that light you up, right? Yeah, okay,
that's your prompt, right there. That's it,
right? Who earns and creates financial abundance in your life? Are you? Can you send, can
you send me this? Yes, or just, yeah, just a link to to the and
I'm pretty sure that, like I said, I think I created a second one of these that was even a bit more detailed. I think I'm if I'm remembering correctly,
here we go.
So yeah, that's one excellent. And then I think it was flow, identity, flow too. I think that this, oh, this is kind of the same. This is the same, but I think it did a different one for him. That's what I'm looking for.
Yeah, okay, no, this is great. Okay. So also,
I don't know if you've seen this, but these are I made this when I very first met Jake. Was like, these are all the things that I want to create. Oh,
wow, yeah, with AI. And
this is the whole program. So we can get to that later. I need to probably put these all into one big file, which I don't have at the moment,
coaching, okay, that's, that's his document. Let's see.
Yeah, I know that I did another one, but, you know, it could have done a weird thing where it like, went into the wrong sometimes it, you know, you start something, it goes in a in the wrong
eye, all exactly what you're talking about.
So let me see if it's policy, like, for example, these are all things for the lawsuit that are like in here, which, Ah, here we go see coach questions phases, I'm pretty sure it's sweet,
yeah, actually, I'm
going to save this. Let me, let me open my I have all this stuff saved already. Yeah, I have a lot of this stuff. I
mean, you guys have to have this stuff because I have a coach notes.
I have a thing about Coach notes that's, yeah, this isn't very big, but I'm going to save all this other stuff that you just gave me in here.
Okay, client thinks about client response, yeah. Is there anything? Yes, I want to add traveler. Okay, welcome back. User response, okay, well, that's
the second one. This
was the second one. And this I didn't do the this was and by the way, since I did this, this part all works. It's the part that I haven't defined yet that doesn't work as well. So maybe I need to, but to be honest, it is in this one. This is correct.
Okay, yeah, so I noticed there's only nine, though, or there's only eight. There's supposed to,
because this one just didn't get the number. It just didn't have the, Oh,
that. Look at that. Okay, great,
personal parents, yeah, eight, so there's nine. It's just yeah, it's just not
okay, okay, okay, I see, okay, good, so we'll do this real quick. I
Okay, so here look, I even have this kind of breakdown of like a true back and forth, even though I have the detail.
So here's what I like that I don't know if this is doing, and I think it's really nice to make it easier for the consumers or the user. So now let's move to maker of money. You already have visionary entrepreneur. So what it should do is it should look at your original list and suggest the category you already chose. Right? Does it feel good for you? Do you want to make it better? Do you whatever, right? So it should also, like, do this heavy lifting for you. Now, keeper of money. Like, you know, you said that you haven't been great at keeping money, but now you want to be a smart investor. Yeah, I want to be someone who manages money. Well, okay, the coach is like, what about wealth? Architect? So you have you read through this,
not all the way. This is great. I haven't seen this document yet. This is not a document I have seen yet,
okay, but this has the whole, this is the whole conversation like, yeah,
no, this is great. This is exactly what needs to go in your prompt.
I actually gave this to Jake in the beginning. I was like, No, I actually want the conversation to go exactly like the document I gave you. Yeah, okay,
now, okay, I didn't know this existed. You already wrote your prompts then like you don't even need to do anything. Okay, great, yeah, with this, with this information, and with the context that we're going to provide it from the from the identities and stuff, you it should this should be you should be fine. Yeah, I think even with
a little bit here, like, Okay, so here's something. But again, if it did this, I would be really happy. We only really need this kind of breakdown of, like, each individual thing once, then after that, the categories go away and they never exist again. All that matters is your team, your people, right? Like the categories are only for creating the identities, and once the identities are created, we don't need these categories
 like anymore, like they go away, because they're very distracting. What I actually want you to do is focus on visionary entrepreneur, wealth architect, spiritual seeker, confident, icon, Warrior, family, connector, devoted partner, captain of my life, whatever it is, right, right? Like, all the categories, like, the whole point of the categories is just for you to create your relationship to it, and then it's something outside of yourself. And we want to get rid of all of that. Everything we're working with is something that's inside of us.
Yeah, yeah, I see what you're saying. So it's just a like, these, these identity context keys are a means to an end to get your identity so that you can then use it later as a tool. Is that right?
Right? Yes. And then. So now, once you have this like, amazing set of like, fuck yeah, these are the people that I am, then you'll see this next one is like, I'm, you know, these are my statements. And I don't know if this is it didn't really go through the thing of prompting it, but, like, once it has this conversation with you, if the conversation is good, the the AI should be able to write the I am statement, like, just from what it knows about the customer, and then our the client and or the user, and then ask them, Is there anything missing? Is there something I should add? Does that feel good? Does it not like, you know, like I want to do the lift. But let's again, we're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's just get it to do the first thing. Okay,
I'm gonna Okay. So these, so these, okay, let me, let me see if I make sure. So the first version, the brainstorming version, of the identities are supposed to be these master storytellers, you know, wild explorers. These, these, like two word, short phrase, kind of descriptive identities actually
even easier look. This one is doing a pretty good job of like making it sexy right off the bat.
Yeah, the way
we have it now is actually even simpler. It's like you just need adventurer investor, yeah,
so I stuck that, let's try, let's try this. Let's I'm gonna save these changes. Okay, and then I want to go back to the test, and I want to start this again. You want to reset my conversation, okay? And then I want to say yes, all right. And then it's going to move to the identity brainstorming section. So the prompt should say, I'm
let's see.
Okay, all right, yeah, so it's doing the transition message that it does, okay. Now I want to see what it does. You can't see my screen at all. Can
you sorry I took mine off. Sorry, yeah,
let me, let me do that. Let me do that. I don't know which one of these you can see. This one can is this one you can see?
Okay, yeah, I don't know which screen you're looking at. I think it's this
one. Okay, great,
okay, great, great, great, great. Okay, so now i Okay, great, look. So we have this here. We'll have to work on the transition, right? The transition sucks. I'm sorry you just
cut and paste what I put and put it in there. Yeah,
exactly. That's exactly right, yeah, I just stuck it in there. So, yeah. So I don't like this. This is, I guess that's right. Is that right? Oh
no, no, because it's like, let's start blaming, uh, okay.
Like, you should never say, like, this should it should never say keeper of money, ever, right? Like, well, it
should.
But the thing is, fantastic engineer is a powerful identity. Um, yeah. Like, it's, it's actually skipping. Oh, weird. It's,
well, no, okay, it skipped. It skips because I told it to skip. It skipped because it said I already have my passion to the talents and maker of money done. It's moving on to keeper of money exactly like it should, because the context that I created said, I already have those two. So it's doing keeper of money, because that's where I don't have an identity yet. That's what it's doing. So it's I can create these test cases to do however you want. So if I made it, if I came up with identities for all of these, and my last one was DOER of things, it should be on. Doer of things, Ooh,
okay, got it, got it, right?
That's kind of how this context will work, right? So like, as you go through these, it'll check it off and move, move down the list, right?
But you know what? We still need this section. It still needs to ask the first question. I mean, again, you did this. The first
question comes from the the introduction prompt, because it's, it's weird how it works. Because when you like, okay, it sends the message, and the bot is still in the transition state right when you come back. So you send your message in, when you send that message in, you're going to get a response, but the response is getting created with the i with the introduction prompt, right? I don't know if I'm making any sense, so it's, it's it kind of leap it leap frogs, right? When you say yes, the response to yes, that I'm ready is getting created with the introduction prompt. It's going to transition your state over, right? But the response that great. Let's dive into the exciting process of exploring identities you inhabit every day that's coming from the introduction prompt, not the identity brainstorming state. Prompt, okay,
again. And we did a thing where you did the passions and talents. And the one thing about that we need to realize in here is that passions and talents is actually multiple. Most people have two or three of those. Oh,
for sure, you
know, so one is not really sufficient, um, but one for every other category is except for some people have multiple family ones that they're very family people, then they have, like, a strong, you know, connection to that. Some people have multiples, but for the most part, it's one for one, except for passions and talents. Yeah.
So anyways, this is all very interesting. Okay,
yeah, so I don't can. I hope you can see it's a really very rudimentary example, but you can see how having, just having this little context in here should, like, directs the bot immediately, and as if it was going through and it had an action where it could mark it off, and then the updated data was then sent into the next prompt. It would, it would just move through. Well, what's really
great about this is I could do this for I could do this for, like, because I have some people who, like, have some of it done, but need their I am. But anyways, we're getting into the weeds. Yeah, someone's coming to the door, and I've got a Yeah, no
worries. Really quick. Give
me one second. Quick. Give
me one sec,
so I'll schedule time. Call. Probably next week for the Okay, yeah, okay, that's all that's up.
Oh, did you put this on the mat for someone? Yes, okay, Eric, he's like, I found $10 in the mat. She gave it to someone, and you took it
away. Yeah, got it? Okay, great. So that's for you. Okay, we get the answer
yes. He is this way, right?
Yeah, okay, yeah. Is everything else good? Yeah, okay, great. Okay, everything's great. Well, I mean, except my breath. Well,
yeah, Tom tell me. For
the trash
can, like all the time.
No, okay, okay, well, now it's gonna die faster because it's opening itself. Oh,
I did clean the sun, yeah. And then I took it off. It stopped a while. But also, those
are your that's the best,
yeah. And then the excuses are crazy. What do you do? Well, see, okay, so
there's two machines to do something like honor the two little things. There's like the outside, there's two little like, yeah, black and a brown, yeah. Okay, so you need to charge those, like, USB chargers, or
inside, you're not outside, oh, I've never
had a divorce.
No, never have experience, really,
but those things work. Okay, outside, yeah, so you just kind of, I'm like, yeah, yeah, some
I have, yeah, yeah, fine. I mean, look, we did, like,
right, and yeah, and so I was like,
but I'm definitely,
but I'm kind
of like,
you okay.
Okay, I'm back.
Excellent. Okay,
cool. Okay, this time I gave you the, I just tried to run through it again. It gave you the, gave some examples.
But again,
it's going to have to get we'll have to, I think what we're going to do is try to see if we can get it to do all of your examples, and get each one of these, all nine of these categories, into a single prompt. If not, we'll trends. We'll, we'll make each one of these a phase you just go through. And each one of them has their own prompt, and it focuses on that. That'll be last that'll be the like a worst case scenario. If we can't get it to work, let's
just see what this says. Oops, I can't type.
I i This is okay, there's some error going on with this bot to see that it's just repeating
the same thing. And that was what was happening to us early.
I don't know why that's doing that. Let me run the local one and see what the heck is going on, because it's
not adding to the master list, and then moving forward, it's just like repeating it. But you should
never do this. It's even and it's like, it's like a complete it's adding it to the like. I don't know if you can see in here, but the the chat message went from five to seven, exactly like it should. The coach state is the same. All this stuff is the same. The coaching system is a prompt. It's just the message is the exact same as the one before it. That is weird, because even if you just call an LLM twice, you won't get the same answer twice. I'm gonna have to see what that's doing. That's weird. That's a weird thing. Never seen it before, of course, right? That's how this is gonna go. Right, right,
right. That's power path. I don't want this one. Let me do.
We go, Oops, I'm
all right, so this one more time. I want to see I want to see what it's doing. I have the logs. I can see all the logs and everything, see what it's doing.
It's really weird. Okay, so transition state just like it was supposed to. That's good. I'm just going to do The same thing. I'm
okay, okay.
I just figured out something silly. Look, this is dumb. This is a dumb mistake on my part in the prompt, in the prompt for the brain, the brainstorming on version three. I need to fix it so that it's the most recent version by default. But we don't. We didn't put the we didn't put the recent messages in here, so it has no idea what was said before. That's doesn't excuse why it was doing that weird double thing. But the but we have the recent messages, and I'm leaving this is the identities. That'll be the context that we'll add in here.
For here, we can get rid of these things. We don't actually need these. We don't need any of this. And sure if we do that, save those changes.
I'm say the same thing.
Yeah, it's weird. I
this is the, this is the message history. User, yes, coach. User, I'm gonna
have to look at this and find out what it's doing. This is part of this. Is part of it. It's part of the
just
fun, right? Yeah, yeah,
getting it to talk how you want, and figuring out what you have to say and how to say it
and all that. Yeah, yes. So
I think that I've exhausted my gas tank for the day. So if you call it, I am totally down. Um, yeah, I don't did
I don't know if I helped you at all with with these prompts, no, I
think that. No. I think that we may look, what I want to start to understand is the logic I showed you. Look, here are all these problems. We solve it by shifting the entire shifting, the entire construct of the of the prompt, right? So you did help me, and I think that. But the thing is, I think that I do need more hand holding, but I think just it is really good because it allows me to, like, get into the guts of what's wrong. And, you know, I think this is interesting. And, like, I said, I was right. I was like, This is wrong, but, like, fix I can't fix it, line by line solution. Yeah, right. It's
one of those where you you know the right answer when you're told, like, you know the right answer when you see it right, you
did this whole thing. Like, no, we're going to change everything, because what we want to do is fundamentally different than what this says, yes. So there are little lines of something that need to be changed. Great, but this became an entirely different thing. And I have some follow up homework, which, you know, again, I kind of am just giving myself this week. I'm glad, I'm glad we kicked the can down the road a little bit with this, because I didn't want to leave this for too long. But hopefully next week, like, I don't know, honestly, when I'm going to be able to get back on my bike, because it's but, and then, like I said, Tomorrow's my birthday, you know, oh yeah. And I should take a little bit of it on Friday, but I'm
going to be, I'll be, I'm going to be gone over the weekend. I'm going to have my laptop. I'm going to have my laptop with me, so I should be able to work if I need to, but I'm going to be, it's not like a huge vacation or anything. My My me, my family are going to Madrid for the weekend. Oh, fun.
I love Madrid. Yeah,
it's, I've only, I only went once, like 10 years ago, and so it's
one of my favorite places in I like it better than Barcelona, which I did not like Barcelona.
Really like
Barcelona. It was
way too big. It was like, LA,
it's like, it,
I'm from LA, so it's kind of like, this kind of feels. I mean, like, look, I like the Gothic Quarter. It's super cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I love the paella. Like, not mad at
Yeah, no,
and, but I don't know, like, just the Gowdy stuff is not really my style. I'm a bit more classic, yeah, when it comes to architecture and whatever. So, I mean, for me, Barcelona, isn't it, but like, Madrid, Madrid has that, like, old
soul vibe. I really like it, yeah, yeah,
this would be super fun. We're taking our kid, we've got kid, we'll have tiny kids with us. So it's going to be, that'll be, that'll be fun. My kids are five and seven, so we're going to go do the boats right where you can go out on that there's like, a big lake in that part, in that giant Park. So, yeah, we're just going to go, we're going to go, have a good time. Go have a great weekend.
Yeah, I feel, look, I feel like we this is good if you have something that you need to, want to do, or I'm
going to work on this, this, this thing, because it's, it's required, right? There's not going to be, well, if you want to do it the right way, I think, I think it should be done, okay,
let's do it the right way, because all the infrastructure
set up, I don't, I don't think it will take me very long. So, and
then what I'll do is I have those two, I have those two important kind of, uh, notes that I made for myself to make. I
will use those. I'm going to use those for the very important
things. And then I think that I also want to make a little bit. I'll make a flow chart, but then I'll also do, like, a kind of description of, like the goal for each
phase. Yeah, that's a
good idea. And then maybe also to think about so, like, there's going to be a difference between the the actual, like, if you were doing it, the phases that you would have, versus the phases that this bot might have, right? Agree, right? So, like, these logical sections that are, like, I've heard
them together, but this, like, we're going to make it very segmented for him, yeah,
and it might like, it's basically like, does, is what the bot is doing? Does it need special instructions to do this, right? And if the answer is yes, then it should be its
own phase. Mm, well, I also think does it have a specific goal, end goal? Yeah, right. If it has a specific end goal that's necessary before moving forward, I think it should probably be its own phase,
yeah. And also, if we can get those, if we have those goals, those should be part of the prompts, for sure your goal is this during this phase, right? Yeah. So I, I'm going to, I'm going to do this. I can. I'm going to add in the context I have. I took really good notes. I have a whole, there's a whole system in here set up so that I can add actions and context keys. So I'll be able to go in and say, I want to do these actions, I want to add in these context keys. And so the what I mean by context key is, I'll be able to add this, I'll be able to construct this little version of the prompt and say, when you go in here and you come up here and you say, required context keys is, you know, identity, context, or whatever we'll call it, I need to come up with some, like, a docs page that, like, maybe explains, or I can probably or like, a tool tip or something on top of These that says, like, like, if you're like, like, if you're like, What the heck is this like? Number of identities. What is this like? What do you actually get when I click? When I click this? What goes in the prompt, right? So you can something that pops up and says what it is, because I'm going to lose track of all these. The other thing
that I think is very helpful here, that I didn't understand or whatever before, was exactly how to break it up into what size chunks. And so now I can, kind of, now that I've, like, been in here, in the vowels, I can start to understand what's going to be required to make the whole thing. And I think that that's really, really helpful.
Yeah, yeah. It'll that. I'll tell you my I've gotten good results from every everybody that I work with all day long is non technical. They don't nobody. Nobody's technical at all. And the it's, it's my job as a as a software engineer, to translate what you want into technical requirements that I can then turn into a thing, right? That's my job. It's my job to translate all of that stuff. But I've noticed that if, if not, if you it can involve people who are typically not technical in the technical process, even just a little bit, it opens up their brain to possibilities that they didn't know have even existed, and then you get better ideas out of them, right? It's like, you just like, I didn't know I could do this. Like, let's do this and this and this, right? So yeah, exactly
what I need to learn enough so that I can be effective and I can understand what we're doing with like, when I was first working in design, I was like, Can I learn a figma? Everyone's kind of like, No. And I'm like, but I want to know how it's done so that I can figure out how to do it. Yeah, I'm a leader. And, like, if I have a fucking blindfold on, like, how well can I lead? You know, so given me the eyes inside. And, like I said, I looked at this and I was like, Okay, well, I know all the stuff that's wrong, but I actually don't know how to fix so I think, I think that we did great work today. One
thing I want you to take away from this is the idea that you don't need the context keys, because this this prompt, we could just throw this away, right? You saw we just made this prompt, and we wouldn't use the bot, and then I like it, or I don't delete bye, bye, right? It's you don't. You're not gonna break anything. You're not gonna hurt anything by doing this prompt. So what you and you
understand my hesitancy, 100%
100 the key thing is, is that if you're like, I want my chat bot to have XYZ information that it currently doesn't have, you do not have to wait on me to go and put it in to give you your context key. Just type it in. Just give it some example stuff, right? And just know what your example is. And then when you go talk to the chat bot, expect some certain response, right? Like, oh, I didn't get what I wanted. Let me add this, let me change this. Serve, and then you can kind of,
yeah, I actually think a few more hand holding sessions and then I will be unleashed. But I think in general, I'm a little bit, like, less sharp than I usually am, and also like, No,
I'm not. No judgment, no judgment on my part at all. The what I really like the real thing, what I really, really wanted to accomplish by exposing this part of the app to you was two main things. One was so that you can see specifically what the instructions are, and then you don't even need to read, you don't even need to type them or change them, or any of that, just so that you can see them and then say that's wrong. Like, that's not what I mean, right? I was
like, well, now I know why it's doing all these things I don't want it to do. Yes, it's doing this that I don't want. It's doing this that I don't want. I'm like, oh,
it's gonna go way faster now, right? You'll be able to say, yeah, and, and also too, it's a feedback mechanism. Now, instead of writing a document or and saying, like, here I needed to do these things, or whatever, you can just be like, I copied the prompt and I changed all the stuff I didn't like to these things. So you guys go fix it right and make it do what it needs to do right based off of what I wrote. Right? There's no okay. So another thing too, I will never just me on, like, from from a technical standpoint, I'm never going to expect for you. I'm not going to sit here and be like, Okay, I need, like, give me the prompt so that the bot can work right. It's not going to work like that, at least for me. Anyway, I'm never going to expect to get a, like, a fully loaded prompt I view, which, so, which is, well, anyway, at trilogy, that is how it works. A lot of people, they're like, I'll do the stuff. And then you give me the prompt, and then the app is yours, like the whether it's up or down or whatever is on you, right? I just did my part. I don't look at it like that, because there's parts of this prompting stuff that ties tech into the technical thing. And so you can mold this thing, but then there's going to be certain things that need to get changed. So changed so that it actually does what you want it to do, right? You'll be able to steer the ship now on your own. Yeah, yeah. But you'll anyway, I just need
to have the confidence to grab the wheel. So I need to watch you drive a little bit more for sure. I'm
down for I'm down for doing these whenever you'd like. You just, well, we'll hop on a call next time we do this. Hopefully we'll have these context keys, and we want, we'll be doing the identity refinement section, because this one's working so well. Hopefully that would be a deal that would
be amazing. And then, and then I'll also have for you, like, the road map of every of everywhere we want to go. One of the things
I'm going to do is start keeping documents. I'm going to keep a kind of, want to keep, like, a page, something that we can keep track. Oh, something else I'm going to do too. I'm going to, I'm telling you that I'm going to do it so that you can either say yay or nay. But this the system context prompt. I'm going to just rip it out. I think for now or drastically, I have to say
that, that I do see some value for it, but the system context prompt, I just think. I just think it's, I think that the first half it was fine and,
yeah,
here's what I can do. Is I can add. I can very easily add. So I wrote this,
it's all extendable, correct. And I also think that next says, I think that the system context prompt just kind of is slightly modified, if that makes sense for each i know this is something that's not modified for each one, but I think it would be better if it was modified for each phase and it didn't have a bunch of stuff that wasn't required for this phase, because that's
what
so the way to handle that is to is to delete it and then just shove it at the top of this of this prompt here. So at the top you would just poop and then type in system context, blah, blah, blah, and whatever you want your context to be for that one, you just show it at the top, because that's all the system message does. It's just takes that and then puts it at the top and then sticks all this stuff underneath it, and assembles the prompt like that in pieces.
Oh, because right now you have it. It's going in every single one. It's in every
prompt, yep. Messages in every at the top of every single brand. And then we would
have to either edit it or just get rid of the whole thing and add what we want. So it's kind of two eggs. So what
I'll do here's, what
half a dozen. It's kind of the same, because we either need to, like, modify each one, or if you want,
what I can do is I can add at the beginning of this. So before the introduction, right here, there would just be a system message or a system flag. That would be the same thing, except it would just show the system prompt that you would get loaded in there. I'll load in the current one so you can see it. And then you can just make revisions of this one too, just the same as you can make any of these other ones,
right. And then
with the understanding that this one would get stuck on the top right. This is where, yeah, this would be, you know, like, the base context, and we can mess with it. Awesome, great. I think things are going to start to move. I think you're gonna, it's been a lot of like, kind of, like, slogging to, like, get things up and running. But I think this is gonna, we're gonna go quick. It's gonna go, Okay,
I love that. All right. Perfect. Excellent, excellent.
Enjoy your birthday tomorrow. I'll try to, I'll try to shoot you a happy birthday on Discord. But I'm not going to get offended if you don't read it well,
you know, hopefully you're off
enjoying your birthday. Usually,
like tonight, all my European and international friends start hitting because, like the day, you know, you start getting the night before messages for whatever reason, you know. But all good. And thank you so much. and.
Excellent. Bye.
