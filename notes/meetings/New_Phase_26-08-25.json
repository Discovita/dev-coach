Is this identity integral to your being, something you want to focus on, nurture and pursue, right? And they should say yes and no for each one. And if the answer is yes, then you move on. If the answer is no, then it's like, Okay, does it kind of, does it belong nested under something else? Or do you want to eliminate it immediately, like, completely, and then that way they can say, like, oh, well, you know, it's actually like, for example, one of the ones that nested for me was like, Chef. Like, you know what? Like, yes, I am chef, and it's something that I love, but it's not like something that I want to pursue individually, like, and so I put it under my healer, like, it's just part of my healer. So if you do that, if you do that, it's just, all they should do is keep it for notes later, for the I Am, you know what I mean, and if they ever need it. And really, it's also just, it's only for the client to really understand, like, okay, like my chef is part of my magical healer. Great. And then if the answer is like, No, I actually don't need this at all. It doesn't belong in my life, like I have it here, but it's not something that's important to me. Great. Okay, so, so when you do the nesting, it's only, the only reason that the nesting is important is just for them to understand, in their heart and in their mind, when they're doing things, that it's the magical healer that's cooking dinner and not a chef.",

This that that's an exercise by the by that we facilitate, right? But the real question for the people or the person is like now, now we're asking you what is important to you, because basically your identities that you come out of the refinement phase or out of this check phase, are going to be all the things that are going to like, direct and guide your entire life that you're going to focus on. So now you have to ask yourself, like, is this important, and is this what we actually want you to focus is this what you actually want to be focusing on in your life? The exercise is to help you come up with the list of things that we suggest, but then it's your job to say whether or not these are important to you that you want to pursue, right?

It goes into detail for every single action that you can perform, every single context key that there is, and what you get when you say, I want to use this context key. And then all of that information that we put in that Bible document that we wrote about the coach, the coaching philosophy, and all of the identity categories and the different phases and all that information is all here. Everything is in this awesome well, it's in a nice it's ugly. I'll tell you. It's ugly because it's, I used a framework for it. The framework is called docusaurus. It's, it's a I actually just learned about it the other day. I didn't know. I had no idea this even existed, and it's now my go to thing for all docs. I will always use this forever from now on. It's fantastic. I love it. It's nice because I have a like in in the I have what's called a mono repo for this, for this project, and there's a front end and a back end folder. And then inside of each one of those things, I have the whole front end app and then the whole back end app, so I can keep all of them all together. But then within each one of those, they all had their own docs. And so I would like keep, like, Oh, here's this, here's these notes, here's this thing. It was all kind of spread out. And so now I have a whole front end devoted just for Docs. So I have, I have the front end docs and the back end, and now I can, I'm working on merging and putting, like, getting rid of all of the docs out of the all the other place, and making this the central, the central thing. But it's really cool because you can, you can, you can edit them directly here. So if you see something that you don't like, you can click edit this page, and it will take you to the GitHub repo, where the where the stuff is sorted, and it's just written in Markdown. It's not code, it's text. So you can just edit it, right? You can just edit it and change whatever you want, and click Save. And then it'll, you know, it'll update the it'll update it the next time we deploy it.",
