Because before you go through every single one, you want to kind of whittle, whittle it down, right? So it does kind of ask any adjustments or additions you'd like to make.

    "content": "Yeah, it's, it's basically, it's essentially the same. But this will now when you do, when you do this part. Now what I did is I made the way that the brainstorming worked. Is brainstorming is the most complicated phase that we've got, yeah, and so the way that it works is it's got a it has a second layer of prompting underneath it, so it has the regular phase prompt where it's stepping through the prompts, but once it gets to identity brainstorming, it like it has these other prompts that it cycles through, and it's like a little miniature chat bot inside. It's like a fractal, like, so, yeah, okay, so you can't see those prompts. I have them just hard coded in here, but what it is is it's the main prompt that you can see. If you go to prompts, you can see it, but at the bottom of the brainstorming phase prompt, there's a thing called Identity brainstorming context, and that context gets filled in with specific instructions for what category you're on. So depending on which identity category you're going through at the time, it has specific instructions for how it's supposed to talk to you, what it's supposed to do, and usually it goes quick, right? So it kind of does its thing, but it's got all the edge cases in there for how, how you're how you talk, how you respond, what you say, and all the different researchy type stuff. What I did is, at the end of all of that, and when you get to DOER of things, what I had it do was I had it transition from DOER of things out to the refinement phase. And so now what we do is I created a new category, just an internal category. It doesn't have anything to do with the coach. To do with the coach, of course. Yeah. So now, when you finish Doer things, you go to a review category, so it sets it to review, and then that has a special prompt that goes through all of this stuff. And so I was pulling this, the instructions for this up so that, oh, wow, just saw something. Oh, yeah, that's something else I needed up. Okay, yeah, I must have been sleepy. I have a version down here. Okay, yeah, it's fine. It's just a I have a copy of the prompt and then a copy of the prompt right below it. So it's like two the same"

Take a moment to acknowledge this accomplishment. Then that it asks a critical question. It says, I tell it to defer to whatever they say anyway. So it goes through step one, celebrate what they created, and then it tells you how to do it. To do it. Step two is ask the critical question, which is, before we move on, is there anything missing, right? So it asks that, is there anything missing thing? So that was the huge thing that you there. Was like, okay, that needs to get added in, for sure. That's where this will get added. And then basically forks off. And it says basically that they say, No, you just go right to the the refinement phase, no questions asked. And then there's stuff to do if they say something is missing. Basically, I list out all of the different categories again, because the context is gone now for each one of them. So there's a little line in there for each one of those. Yeah. And then, if it's not obvious which category it should go in. I tell it to put it in passions and talents, because that's where else would you put it. I thought about creating a new category for like the missing so you could keep track. But then I was I realized that those categories are just gone the second that you move out into"

But in before refinement, what we want to do before we refine. It's like, for example, like I said, I have two that are duplicated in here, okay, so more that are kind of lifelong learner and explorer. Those are going to get combined in my world, okay?

And I don't these two are the same and these two are the same. So let's just pick one, or let's combine them even, even we don't even need to pick one, but we would say for the refinement, it would be health enthusiast slash seeker, right? Or health enthusiast health seeker. They're together on a line, so that when you refine it, you can choose the right word, same thing, kind of lifelong learner and explore like those are kind of the same to me.

But here's the thing where this is where it gets weird, yeah, where it gets weird is if you put instructions in there for to combine things, that's a gray line, and you're asking the LLM to make a decision, and you're do a thing, which is perfectly fine, but what you might end up with is it suggesting to combine identities don't need to get combined. Right, right? Well, we can write the we can write the prompt so that it won't be that won't be super weird, but like, what you want, what I would want to avoid is, is having a list of identities that can't get combined, and then having the thing suggest combine some right?

I don't know if you can click. Like health seeker and health enthusiast are the same, because those are the only two that really need to be the same. Leigh's long because those are obvious. I mean, I don't know. But also, like I also see lifelong learner and explorer, also similar. But if I tease those all the way out at the very end, when you ask, is this integral to your life, something you want to focus on, nurture and pursue? That's another way to reduce right so, but right now I could see I could differentiate lifelong learner and explore. Those are pretty much the same. Health seeker and health enthusiast, those are the same. So we combine those two and come up with one name for them in the refinement process. But I don't know. I don't want the coach combined, because I know what it'll do. It'll combine everything."

It's not gonna do I've seen it do that kind of stuff. No, I won't do that anymore. The only way that it can do anything like that is if I give it an action, like an actual thing that it can do, because otherwise it doesn't have the it doesn't have the, it won't have just the code won't exist for it to do it. Okay, we'll be able to touch the database in that way. So, but what I can give it is instructions to say, Hey, would you maybe want to combine these two? And then I can give it. I can give it. We can make it a component so that the user says, Hey, you want to combine these two, and when they click, yes, then it'll get combined right? And then we can say, we can make sure that the parameters are correct. So basically, what you would you wouldn't be combining them. I don't maybe, well, you're Oh, yeah.

I mean that one again, I don't think it's the end of the world, but, but I think that you could write like, these ones are kind of, these ones are similar, you know. And so then it can take and then it just brings them up together in the refinement phase. Does that make sense? Oh, okay, like, yeah, the it would be health seeker, health enthusiast, which name do you prefer? And then it would be if I had pointed out lifelong learner and explorer, okay, it would say explore, lifelong learner, slash explorer, what? What name do you want for this? And again,"

I think that the right way to do what you want, because that's what you said. Is great to be able to take to like, kind of do them both right. I think the best way to do that is just to carry the names forward. And so what we would do when you combine two if we do that, what happens is you keep both names right. You delete one of them, but then the one that stays becomes right. In this case, it would be health enthusiast slash health seeker, right? Just stay with the two names combined. You don't come up with a new name. Now, you don't do any of that stuff, right, right, right. You now have the one identity with the two names to write it was. And then when you do it in refinement phase, we could tell the coach that, you know, if it has a slash in the name, or whatever, or I can put some parameter on it, we can have the coach update that it was, you know, this is a combined one, and it can handle it that way. I think that's probably the best."

So what you want to do is you want to take the passions and talents one and combine it with the wealth seeker. You want to take same thing in lifelong explorer and learner. Those who go together, they're both passions and talents, right? The the health seeker, the health enthusiast, would come out of passions and talents and go into health seeker as or maybe I created two, I think I created two in the physical expression.

So by at the end of the identity brainstorming phase, you want to have at least one in every category, and the goal should be, that's what the goal should be. And remove redundancy by merging any superfluous identities you have in passions and talents that overlap too much with some of the ones that you have to keep right?"

Then I just have one in as athlete, in my physical appearance. Does that make sense? Because I did a double, which is how I ended up with the double. Then the other thing was, in the passions and talents, these are very easily overlapping, and so we don't want redundancy. We don't want to overdevelop, because we're going to ask them to we're going to ask them to remove it later if it's not something that's like, super important to them. Because what you have done yet is you use these identities as kind of like characters in your own personal film of life, and you're deploying them in the world. And so if you have, like, a lifelong learner and an explorer, for me, like my Explorer is my learner, we're out exploring. We're learning, you know, yeah, so you want to make sure that you don't have someone who's like, doesn't have that much to"

But currently, the way that the brainstorming phase works, if somebody wants to put more than one identity in one of the major categories, they're going to have to tell, like, I have to tell the coach.

And I was like, and I was like, that's I don't, I can do that later, if she wants me to. And I skipped it, and I'm glad I did. Yeah, so you can, you can force it and say, but you're gonna like, it's gonna just say, once you have one, it's gonna be like, Okay, next, right? And you have to be like, no, no, I want. I"

And then, like, eventually you're like, No, you know, because for me, for a long time, when I was first doing it, I had, you know, warrior and athlete, and they were separate, or warrior and dancer, I think I had, because those were my two, like, major athletics pursuits. And then I decided, like, I don't need warrior and dancer, because even when I'm dancing, it's a little bit of warrior energy, so I'm going to just be warrior. That was my athletic identity, wow. Then I went down the road of that for a while, and I realized, Oh, my God, this is a trauma response. I don't need to be a warrior anymore. I could be something else here, you know. And I edited from there. So I think that there is a lot look, this is a journey, and we are taking them on the journey. Like, the first journey is like, expansive, like, think of everything you could be, right? Because you have the first list, then it's like, think of everything you are in these categories, right? Then it's like, think of, you know. And there should be a point later where you know, when we ask, is there anything missing. Like, you know, kind of can refer back to that very first list and be like, well, like you said, pianist on here, and it's nowhere on this. Like, is that okay? Now, I don't know if it's the most important question to ask in the beginning, because the truth is, we're going to refine these 100 times. And in the beginning we kind of want to get people like, through the process, but like, later we might come back when we do our first review, like quarterly review, of your identities. Like, be like, remember this just, just for, like, some inspiration, these were the first things you said you were, and these were the things you said you wanted to be. Are they represented here, just as, like, a brainstorming exercise, you know? Yeah. But for now, like, I'm just looking at this list that I came up with, and it's like, look, I've got a couple of redundancies here. We could slim it down so that when we go to refinement, we're not refining identities twice."

And it'll just yes or no, and if you do, it'll go back to it. And if not, then, yeah, yeah, cool. I haven't figured out. So one thing for that, the skipped category thing, I haven't I haven't figured out a good way to to do it in the chat, but what it should do is it should set the focused category back to that one and then redo it. But the problem is, is that they work in a chain, and if you are on one, the instructions tell you to go to the next one, right? And so there's no way for me to say, Hey, we're back on this category, but because we skipped it, right? There's no because,"

And I told you this before, the reason for the order is like, we want to start with the path of least resistance. It's easiest for people to think of what is fun for them, right? Right? The things they love, and then for most people to ask people to make of money. It's like, the most important question, right? And then the next one is the create, you know, the keeper of money, which is, like, a really important question. And then we kind of flow through, and we don't get to, like, the really hard stuff. I mean, we have spiritual which is challenging for people, but it's challenging in a kind of mind opening way, even if it's tragic. But then when you get into, like, family, romantic relation, you know, those things, there's a lot more trauma attached to those sort of questions, right? And then, and then the doer of things, we kind of just do it at the end, because it's like a bit of a head scratcher, and kind of it sums everything up.

Like, and then it makes these things, but it should all but it should also say, like, keep, keep the original name here is just trying to change it, right? Like, because, look, most people, you and I, I mean, we've been dealing with this for a while. Like, I'm really excited, once you get the next two scenarios going, I'm going to give this to my, my startup coach who's the one who's like, helped me with a lot of stuff, my startup mentor, and she hasn't done it at all, and so I'm really excited for her to get in there and try it. And same thing with my investor, like once, once it's all the way through ready the chat sections. I'm going to give it to them, and they've never done it.

So like in this instead of artistic Voyager, imaginative traveler, I don't know where it got this idea. It earlier, tried to combine explore and creative.

But what I said was, how about creator, right? And that is just like a much more powerful phrase. So I think what we want to do is we want to give them a strong noun, and that its job is to create a strong noun, because some people are going to come up with this as, like, it's going to all be adjectives, yeah, yeah. You know, like a we wrote I ams because we know what they should be, but for some reasonable it's going to be all adjectives.

Or, if not, tell me a little bit more about this identity so I can help you come up with a good one. And then it says, Okay, well, I'm this, I'm that.

I want to surrender the wisdom, something greater than myself, and not feel that I need to be the authority and everything. I want to turn everything over. But then it just didn't even change it.

You want it to be something that, like, boom, like, hits you super hard in the heart, so that you're inspired by who you want to be every day, right? Or who you are inspired to wake up and be that. This is like, I nurture with love and wisdom, creating a safe and supportive environment for my family of five.

What are some important words that describe who you are, as a mother and like, help me understand, right? And then it writes the I am statement. And then once it writes the I am statement, it's like, do you want to accept this, or do you want to edit it or rewrite it?

Like, instead of like, asking what's inspiring about it, asking what excites you about it, right? And how you want to show it like this part is, and then once it says, okay, wellness warrior, it's like, okay, how does that feel? There's just another answer of like, say, I am a wellness warrior.

The what you want it, you want the user to engage with it beyond a chat bot level, right? So like people are just like people, they have a fence up whenever they're talking to a chat bot. At least I do. I don't know. I'm sure everybody does. Everybody does. Where you're talking to this thing, you're like, I know this is fake. This is like, bullshit. I'm just gonna talk to it.

And like, no one's going to going to tell you you're an idiot. Yeah, be like, you know. So, so I think that there is we have in the personal vulnerability state. There is a opportunity to go beyond what some people feel that they can do in normal conversation, but we it's our job to inspire them. So I think that the most important question about the refinement is like, this has to be a name that that like lights you up, that makes you excited to like, wake up and be this person. This is someone you want to be and you're proud to be every day. And so it's about like driving them towards the purpose of finding a cool name."

Do you know how long it would take me to do it? Would take, yeah, I mean, think of how long it took us. Would take me a long time session, yeah, six hours, and we can do it in one I mean, it's art, and to make the art, I mean, just, it's, it's incredible the fact that we did all this, he went all the way through. I mean, he went to through the refinement, but then he was kind of like, I don't know it's doing this weird thing now, yeah, yeah, all the way through the whole thing in 30 minutes. And let's say we can do the back half in 30 minutes, like, game changer. Also, we can tell people it's an hour, if it takes them an hour and a half, like, who gives them?

What is this person? Like? Give me some descriptive words, whatever. Because my experience when most people are writing the I ams is that it's very it's kind of like pulling teeth on most people, most non creatives.
