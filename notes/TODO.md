# TODO List

[x] GTKY Phase is taking forever
    - Fixed in prompt V4: Added explicit single-question rule (one ? per response), minimum depth requirement (2 exchanges per topic), and concrete good/bad examples
[ ] Warmup Phase examples need to be simpler
    - father, mother, son, daughter, friend, spouse, etc.
[ ] Show Identity Bulletin on the Anything Missing Phase
[ ] Identity statements need gramatical rules
    - https://loom.com/share/318ee38531cf49f8affc66ad07e41b2e
[ ] Be able to tile and rearrange the identies on the the identies page on the purple one
[ ] Image loading is slow
    - Look into lazy loading, loading one at a time, only loading when the user scrolls to it
[ ] Set the visualization phase to unlock images. 
[ ] Update the body customization stuff to be specific based on the users gender. Custom options for men and women (and person)
[ ] Create the image generation tool on the purple one
[ ] Update the settings page on the purple one to include the image upload stuff and the body customization stuff
