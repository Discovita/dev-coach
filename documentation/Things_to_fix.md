# Things to fix

## Coaching Phases

### Get To Know You
- Got this message: "It sounds like you have a rich tapestry of interests! Traveling with your family must be such a wonderful way to create new memories together. It's great that you're able to share those experiences with your kids now that they're old enough.

Your passion for woodworking and music adds such a creative dimension to your life. Having had a full-blown wood shop must have been a fantastic outlet for your creativity and craftsmanship. Do you find that these hobbies influence how you approach your work or other areas of your life?

Before we move on, I'd love to hear a little about your family if you're comfortable sharing. Who's in your world these days?"
    - Asking more than one question should be avoided at all costs. 

### Identity Brainstorming
- Got this message: ""Maker" is a wonderful identity that truly captures your passion for creating and building. It reflects your skills and interests in both carpentry and software engineering, as well as your love for woodworking. This identity embodies your ability to bring ideas to life through your hands and mind.

Let's go ahead and create this identity for you. This will be a foundational part of who you are, and it can influence other areas of your life as well."
    - I don't want it to talk explicitly about creating identities.
