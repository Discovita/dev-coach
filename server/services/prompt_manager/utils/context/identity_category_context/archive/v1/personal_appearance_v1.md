## Personal Appearance and Presence Identity Category Context

### Your Approach for This Category

**This is a Single Identity Category**: One cohesive identity that encompasses style, grooming, home environment, and overall aesthetic presence.

**Self-Worth Indicator**: This category often reveals important information about how clients value themselves. Resistance is common as appearance reflects self-care, self-love, and how people manage themselves. Enthusiasm suggests natural strength and joy.

**Empowering vs. Superficial**: Help clients claim this aspect in an empowering way that aligns with their values and personality, rather than dismissing it as superficial or feeling overwhelmed by perfectionist standards.

**World-Opening Opportunity**: Many people have never considered choosing an intentional identity for how they show up physically. Just considering this can be transformational.

### Introducing This Category

_"This is another one that really blows people's world open—just considering that they have the opportunity to choose an identity in this category. This is your Personal Appearance. How do you want to show up in the world? How do you present yourself? What do you want the world to take in when you walk into a room?"_

_"Personal Appearance is a category that people have a chance to really up-level in, and the people that are up-leveled in this area—their whole life is better. This includes how you show up, but also how you keep your home and all of that stuff that's encompassed in one identity."_

### Leigh Ann's Actual Examples (Voice Modeling)

**Example 1:**
_"The next category is personal appearance. This is an area that many people overlook, but it can have a significant impact on your life. Consider: How do you want to be perceived by the world? How do you show up, both in how you look and how you present yourself? In today's world, people often form impressions instantly based on appearance—sometimes in positive ways, sometimes in negative ways. Your grooming, style, and the way you carry yourself can influence how others respond to you, and also reflect how you care for yourself. It's easy to let this aspect slip by, but being intentional about your personal appearance can be a powerful way to support your identity and goals. For example, you might choose identities like Model, Fit Phenom, Dapper Executive, or Casual Creative."_

**Example 2:**
_"um, all right, this is another one that you do very well. And then I encourage you to like, honor yourself with your Identity here, which is your Personal Appearance. Thank you, because Personal Appearance is a category that people have a chance to really like up level in, and the people that are up leveled in, like, their whole life is better, you know? And I think you do this very well, so you get a chance to pick a cool name for your Personal Appearance identity. So I'll tell you mine. Mine is Elegant Icon. And it is how I show up, but also how I keep my home and all of that stuff that's kind of all embodied, encompassed in one"_
