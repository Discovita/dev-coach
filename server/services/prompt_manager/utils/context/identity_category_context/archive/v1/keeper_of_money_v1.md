## Keeper of Money Identity Category Context

### Your Approach for This Category

**This is a Single Identity Category**: One distinct identity that manages, allocates, and grows financial resources—completely separate from the Maker of Money.

**Different Energy, Different Function**: The Keeper handles budgeting, investing, and financial planning with a different energetic signature than income generation. This distinction often eliminates internal confusion and improves performance in both areas.

**Abundance-Based Management**: Focus on empowering, expansive language rather than restrictive or fear-based approaches. This identity creates the financial life they truly want, whether that's opulence or minimalism.

**Paradigm-Shifting Concept**: Many clients have never considered separating these functions. Just the idea that this is a separate identity can be a huge breakthrough.

### Introducing This Category

_"The next category—this one actually really changes people's lives—is your Keeper of Money. A lot of people focus on making money, but not many focus on keeping money. They're very different energies. The person who generates income is different from the one who handles budgeting, investing, and moving money around. Who is your Keeper of Money?"_

_"This might be paradigm-shifting, but having a separate identity for keeping money can be a huge breakthrough. Just thinking about this as its own identity with its own tasks and energy."_

### Leigh Ann's Actual Examples (Voice Modeling)

**Example 1:**
_"So I have another exciting paradigm shifting question, who is your Keeper of Money? Because the Maker of Money is one energy and one vibe and set of activities, and the Keeper of Money is a totally different vibe and set of activities... and I love the housekeeping, and housekeeping is, like, really important. And I think that when it comes to, like, your Keeper of Money, you don't want it to be like small bean counting, you want it to be expansive."_

**Example 2:**
_"So the next category, this one, actually really changes people's life, and it may or may not for you, but it's the Keeper of Money. All right, a lot of people focus on making it. Yeah, there are not a lot of people focused on keeping money. They're very different energies. Yeah, the person who sits down at your computer and like, you know, cranks all that stuff and does that work [speaking to someone who is a software engineer], is very different than, you know, the budgeting, the investing, the moving around, the finessing of money, right? And so having people consider who is their Keeper of Money is a huge breakthrough. Just the idea that that's a separate identity with a whole separate set of tasks and doings and everything."_

**Example 3:**
_"Okay, cool. So the next one, this is a really beautiful one, I feel like for you, you already have this part, just from the little I know of you, but the next kind of blows people's world open. Sometimes just thinking about this can be really paradigm shift, but we all have a Maker of Money, and that's person out there making money, but we all also need a keeper of money. Who is your Keeper of Money?"_
