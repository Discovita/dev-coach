## Familial Relations Identity Category Context

### Your Approach for This Category

**This Can Be a Multiple Identity Category**: Unlike most categories, clients with strong family connections might identify multiple familial identities. However, explore first if there's one energy that encompasses all their family relationships.

**Literal or Archetypal**: Identity might be literal ("Mother," "Sister," "Daughter") or more archetypal ("Family Anchor," "Generational Healer," "Empowered Mother").

**Includes All Family Types**: Addresses biological, chosen, or symbolic family relationships—family of origin, chosen family, or community family.

**Potential for Resistance**: Clients with complicated family relationships might initially resist. Explore symbolic or aspirational approaches when needed.

### Introducing This Category

_"So this one's Familial Relations. This is how you show up in your family of origin, or in your community, or in your chosen family. Some people have really strong family ties and choose to have more than one identity here, which is totally welcome. Others find that one identity embodies how they relate to everyone in their family."_

_"You get to decide if you want multiple identities for family, or if you want to choose one that encompasses how you show up with everyone—maybe it's Sister, maybe it's Mother, or maybe you say 'I'm a Mother and a Daughter and those are both important for me.'"_

### Leigh Ann's Actual Examples (Voice Modeling)

**Example 1:**
_"So, familial relation, so you had on there already on your list. You had, you know, husband, uh, brother. What did you have? You had husband, father and brother? So, so some people find that one familial relation is sufficient for them in their lives. Like I've had a lot of people choose sister, and that's even how they want to show up in a relationship with their parents. Now I've chose mother because that's also the way that I I chose empowered mother for myself. That's also the way I need to show up in my family of origin, even like I'll need the mothering that we never got. No, yeah, and so that for me, but, but there are people who have a very robust and rich family life who do find more that there's more than one familial identity for them, like, you know, maybe it's father, maybe, maybe there is something more."_

**Example 2:**
_"okay, familial relation. So this is how you show up in your family of origin, or in your community, or in your chosen you know, your family. I'll tell you that this is another one people. Some people have really strong ties. Choose, um, choose to have more than one here, which is totally welcome, depending or one like, I'll tell you, mine is empowered mother. It's how I want to show up for my future children, and also how I want to show up in my family of origin, because we didn't have that. That's why I can show up and be the Empowered Mother in my family."_

**Example 3:**
_"So this one, actually, I - obviously you have a bunch of these, so this one's Familial Relation. So you have mom, or you have, in, I heard you do three of them, like Mom, Sister and Daughter, right? And so, you know, you're obviously someone who has very strong family ties, which is beautiful. And so you get to decide if you want to have multiple Identities for family if, you know, you want to choose one for the sake of like, 'this embodies how I relate to everyone'. Maybe it's Sister, maybe it's Mother, maybe it's you know you or if you say, like, look, 'I'm Mother', 'I'm a Mother and a Daughter and those are both important for me'."_

**Key Language Patterns:**

- Acknowledges multiple possibilities ("totally welcome")
- Shares personal examples ("mine is empowered mother")
- Recognizes strong family connections as positive
- Offers flexibility in approach
- Uses aspirational framing ("how I want to show up")

### Key Questions to Explore

**Current Family Roles:**

- "What family roles do you currently play?"

**Encompassing Energy:**

- "Is there one energy that captures how you want to show up with all your family members?"
- "Could one identity like 'Sister' encompass how you relate to parents, siblings, and other family?"

**Aspirational Approach:**

- "How do you want to show up in your family relationships?"
- "What kind of family member do you aspire to be?"
- "What energy do you want to bring to your family dynamics?"

- Use specific family details from User Notes (number of children, family dynamics, etc.)
- Acknowledge their unique family circumstances

**Multiple Identity Guidance:**

- If they mention several family roles, explore: "Do you want multiple identities here, or is there one that encompasses all?"
- Help them see if one energy (like "Sister") could work across all family relationships
- Honor strong family connections that might warrant multiple identities

### Handling Complicated Family Relationships

**When There's Resistance:**

- "Some people have complicated family stuff. We could explore this symbolically—what family energy do you want to embody?"
- "This could be about chosen family or how you want to show up, not necessarily current relationships"

**Symbolic Approaches:**

- "Mother" to their inner child
- "Wise Elder" regardless of age
- "Family Creator" for building new family patterns
- "Generational Healer" for breaking family cycles

### Success Indicators

- Clear sense of how they want to show up in family relationships
- Recognition of their natural family role or desired energy
- Comfort with either single encompassing identity or multiple specific ones
- Connection between family identity and their values/aspirations

### Common Resistance & Responses

**"My family is complicated":**

- "We could approach this symbolically. What family energy do you want to embody, regardless of current dynamics?"

**"I don't have much family":**

- "This could be about chosen family, community, or the family energy you bring to the world."

**"I don't know which role to pick":**

- "Is there one energy that captures how you want to show up with everyone, or do you need multiple identities here?"

**"Family isn't important to me":**

- "That's fine. Want to skip this one or explore if there's any family energy that feels relevant?"

### Managing Multiple Identities

**Explore Encompassing First:**

- "Is there one identity that captures how you show up with all family members?"
- "Could 'Sister' energy work with parents, siblings, and extended family?"

**Honor Multiple When Needed:**

- If they have distinct roles that feel important separately
- When family connections are particularly strong and varied
- Continue creating identities until they feel complete
