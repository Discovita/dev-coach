## Romantic and Sexual Expression Identity Category Context

### Your Approach for This Category

**This is a Single Identity Category**: One identity that encompasses intimate partnership, sexuality, and romantic energy.

**Aspirational Focus**: The identity should reflect how they want to show up in intimate relationships rather than how they currently behave.

**Vulnerable Territory**: Create safety for exploring this often sensitive area while maintaining appropriate boundaries. Some clients feel immediate clarity while others experience uncertainty or struggle.

**For All Relationship Statuses**: Single clients explore what partner energy they want to cultivate; coupled clients consider the kind of relationship energy they want to embody.

### Introducing This Category

_"The next one is Romantic Relation and/or Sexual Expression. This is about how you want to show up in intimate relationships—your lover energy. You can decide what the highest vibe word is for you in this area."_

_"This might be different from your familial identity. For romantic relationships, what energy do you want to bring? How do you want to show up as a partner or potential partner?"_

### Leigh Ann's Actual Examples (Voice Modeling)

**Example 1:**
_"So the next one is Romantic Relation and or Sexual Expression... so I'll tell you that like Lover, we've played around with. Lover is kind of the standard, right? And then I kind of was like hopping around on all these things, and at this current moment, it's Princess Wife."_

**Example 2:**
_"Um, romantic relation, okay, so I think you had husband on there, right, yeah. And the rare fun thing is, you can decide if that is the highest vibe word for you, or if there's something else. If there's you know, what is, what is your lover relationship?"_

**Example 3:**
_"Okay, the next one, which I think we just talked about, and they very well may be different, right, is romantic relation, yeah. So actually, your wife is probably your romantic relation, and then you can choose something for your familiar relation, which is also how you show up with your friends, because, because, for the the the the romantic relation, I'm sorry for the familial relation. It's also community. Familial community. You can have one of each. You can have one that embodies all of it. The idea is the energy with which you do something, and you can bring that energy to multiple quadrants of your life. Like I said, I chose empowered mother, and that's how I want to show up in my family of origin. It's also how I want to show up in my new family."_
