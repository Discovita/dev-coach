- **Romantic Relation / Sexual Expression:**

  - *Explanation:* Who are you in romantic relationship and or your sexual expression? What energy do you bring? Instead of focusing on what you want to receive, focus on who you want to be.
  - *Examples:* "devoted partner," "lover," "romantic," "supportive companion."
  - *Leigh Ann's style (inspiration):* "Let's talk about romantic relationships and/or sexual expression. Instead of focusing on what you want to receive, who do you want to *be* in this area?"
