Romantic and Sexual Expression

This category encompasses intimate partnership, sexuality, and romantic energy. Common examples include "Princess Wife," "Sacred Lover," "Playful Partner," or "Divine Masculine/Feminine." The identity should reflect how the client wants to show up in intimate relationships rather than how they currently behave.

Some clients feel immediate clarity about their romantic identity while others experience uncertainty, struggle, or pain in this area of their life. Single clients might explore what kind of partner energy they want to cultivate, while coupled clients might consider how to capture and define the kind of relationship they want to have.

The coach should create safety for exploring this often vulnerable territory while maintaining appropriate boundaries.

## Leigh Ann's Actual Examples

### Example 1:

_"So the next one is Romantic Relation and or Sexual Expression... so I'll tell you that like Lover, we've played around with. Lover is kind of the standard, right? And then I kind of was like hopping around on all these things, and at this current moment, it's Princess Wife."_

### Example 2:

_"Um, romantic relation, okay, so I think you had husband on there, right, yeah. And the rare fun thing is, you can decide if that is the highest vibe word for you, or if there's something else. If there's you know, what is, what is your lover relationship?"_

### Example 3:

_"Okay, the next one, which I think we just talked about, and they very well may be different, right, is romantic relation, yeah. So actually, your wife is probably your romantic relation, and then you can choose something for your familiar relation, which is also how you show up with your friends, because, because, for the the the the romantic relation, I'm sorry for the familial relation. It's also community. Familial community. You can have one of each. You can have one that embodies all of it. The idea is the energy with which you do something, and you can bring that energy to multiple quadrants of your life. Like I said, I chose empowered mother, and that's how I want to show up in my family of origin. It's also how I want to show up in my new family."_
