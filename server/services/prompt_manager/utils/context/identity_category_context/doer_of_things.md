Doer of Things

The final category addresses getting things done and handling life's practical necessities.  This identity handles the practical aspects of bringing visions into reality and maintaining daily life responsibilities. Examples might include "Captain of My Life," "Efficient Implementer," or "Graceful Administrator."

Most people struggle with completion functions, so it's important to give them this identity to empower them. The coach's challenge involves helping clients find language that feels empowering rather than burdensome for their executive function. Examples that have resonated include "Problem Solver," "The Driver" (chosen by someone who said "I've been a passenger forever!"), and "Successful Doer."  

The coach's challenge involves helping clients find language that feels empowering rather than burdensome for their executive function. The identity should acknowledge the importance of this capacity while preventing it from overshadowing other aspects of the person.


## Leigh Ann's Actual Examples

### Example 1:

_"So this one is called the doer of things, okay? And this one is like, we all have to go to the DMV and pay our taxes and do our dishes and clean our closet or whatever it is that we might need to do. And we all need a identity that empowers us to do those sorts of things with gratitude and grace and self like affirming. Because, if you like, I have to go to the DMV and you know, yeah, and register my car, and it's like, you're a victim of the DMV and you're whatever, like you're a victim of the IRS, and like, when it becomes a self fulfilling action to take because you are loving yourself that you're going to show up and Pay your taxes so that you can borrow money and that the government doesn't come after you, and you can, you know, you're loving yourself by organizing your closet. You're loving yourself by, you know, checking the things off your list that are tedious and laborious and nobody actually wants to do. I'll tell you, mine is the captain of my life. I am the captain of my life, and I take care of all my duties swiftly and with honor in order to have smooth seas navigating life, because I'm someone who used to, like, avoid all of this stuff, until it became like a giant bomb, yeah, big hole in my life. Then I would have to, like, cover it with something so I could walk over and everything was fine until the next so now we do it different, you know, yeah, now I feel really like that. I'm loving myself by taking, going to the dentist and like, doing these things that I'm really loving myself and affirming my right, yeah, to have, yeah, peace and I love and so there's some really cool ones that people one of the ones that somewhat successful doer, problem solver, the driver. I have another girl who chose the driver, because she's like, I've been a passenger for fucking ever."_

### Example 2:

_"so, um, so anyways, um, okay, the last question is the doer of things? Who is your DOER of things? And this is a very important thing, because we all have stuff we have to do, like, you've got a payer mortgage, or go to the grocery store or, like, register your car, go to the dentist, and like, you know, action is a huge part of life. And you know, there are all sorts of actions that we have to take that aren't necessarily like about our passions and about our dreams, but they can still be a self validating, self fulfilling action, right? And so what I what I say, is important about doing this part of the thing is, like you can make going to and I don't know what you guys have there in Spain, but like the DMV, like a self fulfilling practice, as opposed to, like, some horrible thing that you have to do that you hate, right?"_

### Example 3:

_"And now, the last one is the Doer of Things. So this is your Meticulous Executor. This is your Housekeeper. You are, a fantastic Doer of Things. And usually I have to explain to people like, why we need a Doer of Things, but I don't even think that I need to explain it to you... So, but here, let's explain how you're going to choose the name of your Doer of Things, so that it becomes an elevating experience. Not like it's not 'a dishwasher', you know, it's not 'a slave', and it's not someone who's like panic doing in order to save the world... It's a self validating, self affirming action that you do."_
