And this is a very important thing, because we all have stuff we have to do, like, you've got a payer mortgage, or go to the grocery store or, like, register your car, go to the dentist, and like, you know, action is a huge part of life. And you know, there are all sorts of actions that we have to take that aren't necessarily like about our passions and about our dreams, but they can still be a self validating, self fulfilling action, right? And so what I what I say, is important about doing this part of the thing is, like you can make going to and I don't know what you guys have there in Spain, but like the DMV, like a self fulfilling practice, as opposed to, like, some horrible thing that you have to do that you hate, right?"_
