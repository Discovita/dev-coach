# Identity Category Context

This directory exists as part of a system to allow the Identity Brainstorming Prompt to be able to pull specific content for the prompt depending on what the current Identity Focus is. 

The old way of doing it was to provide specific instructions for every Identity Category within the Identity Brainstorming prompt. This flooded the prompt with mostly unrelated information for whatever the Identity Focus was. 

This attempts to fix that by providing set specific Identity Focus context that can be injected as a Context Key into the Identity Brainstorming prompt at run time.
