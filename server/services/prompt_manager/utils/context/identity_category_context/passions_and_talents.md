## Passions & Talents

### Core Definition

This category encompasses the traits, skills, and interests that make someone uniquely themselves—their foundational personality elements and natural capabilities. These are the things that create energy, excitement, and a sense of authentic self-expression.

### Key Characteristics

- **Multiple Identity Category**: Unlike other categories, clients can have several Passions & Talents identities
- **Energy Indicators**: These are areas where people naturally lose track of time
- **Recognition Patterns**: Often what others consistently notice and appreciate about them
- **Foundational Nature**: These form the base layer of who someone is, informing other categories

### Coaching Approach

#### Key Questions to Explore

- What activities make you lose track of time?
- What do people consistently compliment you on or come to you for?
- What feels effortless and natural to you?
- What aspects of yourself do you feel most proud of?
- When do you feel most like "yourself"?

- "People pleaser" → "Harmony Creator" or "Relationship Nurturer"
- "Workaholic" → "Purpose-Driven Achiever" or "Mission-Focused Builder"

### Leigh Ann's Actual Examples

#### Example 1:

_"The very first category is your Passions and Talents. So these are the things that make you uniquely you. They're kind of your personality, your skills that you've developed, things you like. People are Musicians or Bookworms or Designers or whatever so. And this is a multiple category. You can choose as many as you want, but again, you don't want 10, you know, but things that are your Passions that kind of define you."_

#### Example 2:

_"Let's start with Passions and Talents. These are basically the things that make you you — your personality, the uniqueness of yourself. These are the most variable ones because they're based on your individual temperament. Often, you can easily pick these from the Identities you've already talked about in the warm-up earlier. So let's look at what makes you uniquely you and figure out which of these qualities you want to really highlight and embody."_

#### Example 3:

_"Let's start with your Passions and Talents. These are the things that make you uniquely you. There are multiple of these—some people have two, some people have four or more. These capture your specific personality and style. Are you a bookworm? A social butterfly? A natural leader, or someone who loves to support others? Let's identify what makes you distinctly you."_

### Success Indicators

When Passions & Talents identities are well-crafted, clients experience:

- Immediate recognition: "Yes, that's exactly who I am!"
- Energy surge when saying the identity name
- Natural clarity about how this shows up in daily life
- Excitement about embodying this identity more fully
- Reduced shame about traits they previously saw as "too much"

### Common Resistance Points

- **"I don't want to seem arrogant"**: Help them distinguish between authentic self-recognition and ego inflation
- **"I'm not that special"**: Reframe uniqueness as combination and expression, not superiority
- **"I have too many interests"**: Guide them to find the underlying themes or energy patterns
- **"I don't know what I'm passionate about"**: Start with what they naturally gravitate toward or what energizes them

### Integration Notes

Passions & Talents identities often inform and enhance other categories:

- A "Creator" might show up as an "Innovative Revenue Generator" (Maker of Money)
- A "Connector" might embody "Relationship Architect" (Romantic/Sexual)
- A "Meticulous Executor" might become "Precision Wealth Manager" (Keeper of Money)
