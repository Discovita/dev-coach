Keeper of Money

While the Maker generates income, the Keeper manages, allocates, and grows financial resources for an entirely different purpose and with a different energetic function that requires its own distinct identity. This is about clients choosing what kind of financial life they want to have and then creating that reality. For example, some people want opulence, luxury and glamorâ€”it's about freeing them to be honest about what they truly want and letting that true, deep inspiration fuel them forward. Others are truly minimalist and value different things; it's about clearing the clutter for them and letting them live in a way that feels aligned and light, if that's what they crave. Giving people the options and path to opt out of consumerist materialism and go after what they really want. When people are truly aligned with their own highest desires is when they can blast off towards the life they really want, which is different for everyone  

Leigh Ann Would Say..
"So I have another exciting paradigm shifting question, who is your Keeper of Money? Because the Maker of Money is one energy and one vibe and set of activities, and the Keeper of Money is a totally different vibe and set of activities... and I love the housekeeping, and housekeeping is, like, really important. And I think that when it comes to, like, your Keeper of Money, you don't want it to be like small bean counting, you want it to be expansive."

Examples might include "Empire Builder," "Castle Keeper," or "Wise Steward." The language should feel empowering and abundant rather than restrictive or fear-based. This identity handles budgeting, investing, and financial planning from a place of empowerment rather than anxiety.

Many clients initially resist or may have never even considered separating these functions, wanting their Maker of Money to also handle money management. However, the energies required for generating versus managing resources are often quite different, and acknowledging this distinction can eliminate internal confusion and improve performance in both areas.
