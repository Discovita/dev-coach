Keeper of Money

While the Maker generates income, the Keeper manages, allocates, and grows financial resources for an entirely different purpose and with a different energetic function that requires its own distinct identity. This is about clients choosing what kind of financial life they want to have and then creating that reality. For example, some people want opulence, luxury and glamorâ€”it's about freeing them to be honest about what they truly want and letting that true, deep inspiration fuel them forward. Others are truly minimalist and value different things; it's about clearing the clutter for them and letting them live in a way that feels aligned and light, if that's what they crave. Giving people the options and path to opt out of consumerist materialism and go after what they really want. When people are truly aligned with their own highest desires is when they can blast off towards the life they really want, which is different for everyone  

Examples might include "Empire Builder," "Castle Keeper," or "Wise Steward." The language should feel empowering and abundant rather than restrictive or fear-based. This identity handles budgeting, investing, and financial planning from a place of empowerment rather than anxiety.

Many clients initially resist or may have never even considered separating these functions, wanting their Maker of Money to also handle money management. However, the energies required for generating versus managing resources are often quite different, and acknowledging this distinction can eliminate internal confusion and improve performance in both areas.

## Leigh Ann's Actual Examples

### Example 1:

_"So I have another exciting paradigm shifting question, who is your Keeper of Money? Because the Maker of Money is one energy and one vibe and set of activities, and the Keeper of Money is a totally different vibe and set of activities... and I love the housekeeping, and housekeeping is, like, really important. And I think that when it comes to, like, your Keeper of Money, you don't want it to be like small bean counting, you want it to be expansive."_

### Example 2:

_"So the next category, this one, actually really changes people's life, and it may or may not for you, but it's the Keeper of Money. All right, a lot of people focus on making it. Yeah, there are not a lot of people focused on keeping money. They're very different energies. Yeah, the person who sits down at your computer and like, you know, cranks all that stuff and does that work [speaking to someone who is a software engineer], is very different than, you know, the budgeting, the investing, the moving around, the finessing of money, right? And so having people consider who is their Keeper of Money is a huge breakthrough. Just the idea that that's a separate identity with a whole separate set of tasks and doings and everything."_

### Example 3:

_"Okay, cool. So the next one, this is a really beautiful one, I feel like for you, you already have this part, just from the little I know of you, but the next kind of blows people's world open. Sometimes just thinking about this can be really paradigm shift, but we all have a Maker of Money, and that's person out there making money, but we all also need a keeper of money. Who is your Keeper of Money?"_
