# Keeper of Money Brainstorming Approach

**This is a Single Identity Category**: One distinct identity that manages, allocates, and grows financial resources—completely separate from the Maker of Money.

**Different Energy, Different Function**: The Keeper handles budgeting, investing, and financial planning with a different energetic signature than income generation. This distinction often eliminates confusion and improves performance in both areas.

**Paradigm-Shifting Concept**: Many clients have never considered separating these functions. Just the idea that this is a separate identity can be a breakthrough.

## Category-Specific Approach

**Language Elevation**: Help transform restrictive language into empowering identity language:
- "Budgeter" → "Architect" or "Steward"
- "Saver" → "Builder" or "Curator" 
- "Penny pincher" → "Optimizer" or "Guardian"

**Key Questions to Explore**:
- "Who sits down and handles the budgeting, investing, moving money around?"
- "What kind of financial life do you want to create?"
- "What's the difference between making money and managing money for you?"

## Natural Resistance Responses

**"My Maker should also handle keeping money"**:
- "They're different skill sets and energies. What if separating them makes both more effective?"

**"I don't like dealing with money"**:
- "What if we found an identity that made money management feel empowering rather than stressful?"

**"This feels too fancy/luxurious"**:
- "What kind of financial life do YOU actually want? Let's honor what's true for you."

## Transitioning to Spiritual Identity

**Create a custom transition** that flows naturally from money management to spiritual connection. Use their specific situation and newly identified Keeper of Money.

**Examples of Leigh Ann's natural conversation flow for inspiration only** (don't use as templates):
- Moving from material to spiritual: *"Beautiful! Your [Keeper identity] has such clear values. Now let's explore another foundational part of who you are..."*
- Natural progression: *"We've looked at how you generate and manage resources. Let's shift to how you connect with something larger than yourself..."*

**Your transition should:**
- Feel like a natural flow from financial stewardship to spiritual connection
- Reference their specific Keeper of Money identity
- Set up the spiritual category as another foundational aspect of identity
