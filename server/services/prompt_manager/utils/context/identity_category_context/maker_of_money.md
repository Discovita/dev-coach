Maker of Money

This category addresses the client's relationship to income generation, deliberately separated from concepts of career or professional fulfillment. The "Maker of Money" represents the identity that channels energy into creating financial resources to meet specific needs and desires.

Money is a necessity, not a career construct. Everyone needs moneyâ€”not necessarily a career. This distinction is crucial because it frees clients from the limiting belief that their income source must align with their passions or provide deep fulfillment. Passion fulfillment and money generation can be entirely separate pursuits.


The coaching conversation often reveals important distinctions between what clients think should make them money and what actually does. Someone might logically believe their "Organized Project Manager" should be their primary earner, but discovery work reveals that opportunities and income flow most easily through their "Creative Designer" identity. This insight can be transformational, redirecting energy toward naturally abundant and more inspired paths rather than forcing success through less aligned, more rigid, and expected approaches.

Key Coaching Insight: Help clients understand they need money, not necessarily a fulfilling career. As illustrated by the example: "I need a job" becomes "No, you don't, you need money." This distinction frees clients from limiting beliefs that income sources must align with passions.

The coach should explore both the practical and energetic aspects of money-making, helping clients identify which identity feels most inspiring and sustainable for income generation. This often involves releasing limiting beliefs about what kinds of identities are "allowed" to be profitable, while honoring that passion fulfillment and money generation can be entirely separate pursuits. This category is specifically about making money to satisfy particular needs, not about finding career fulfillment or aligning passion with income.
