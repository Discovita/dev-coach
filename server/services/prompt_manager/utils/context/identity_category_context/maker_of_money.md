## Maker of Money Identity Category Context

### Your Approach for This Category

**This is a Single Identity Category**: Unlike Passions & Talents, clients typically develop one primary "Maker of Money" identity that represents how they channel energy into generating financial resources.

**Separate from Career Fulfillment**: This is deliberately separated from concepts of career satisfaction or passion alignment. The "Maker of Money" is specifically about income generation to meet needs and desires—passion fulfillment and money generation can be entirely separate pursuits.

**Energy-Based Income Generation**: Focus on which identity feels most inspiring and sustainable for making money, not what they think "should" work or what seems most logical. Often the identity that generates money most easily is different from what clients expect.

**Practical Necessity Focus**: Help clients understand they need money, not necessarily a fulfilling career. This distinction frees them from limiting beliefs that income sources must align with passions.

### Introducing This Category

Use natural language that builds on their established identities and User Notes:

_"The next category is your Maker of Money. Who is your Maker of Money? This is about who wakes up in the morning and generates income in your life. And this is a really important distinction—you need money, not necessarily a career. So through what identity do you channel your energy that's going to inspire you when you go to make money?"_

_"Looking at the identities we've explored, who feels most energizing and sustainable for income generation? Sometimes it's not who we think it 'should' be—it's who actually creates the most flow and opportunities."_
