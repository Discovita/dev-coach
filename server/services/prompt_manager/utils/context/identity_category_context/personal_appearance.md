Personal Appearance and Presence

This category addresses how clients show up physically in the world, including style, grooming, home environment, and overall aesthetic presence. Many people have complex relationships with appearance-based identities, either dismissing them as superficial or feeling overwhelmed by perfectionistic standards.

The coach's role involves helping clients claim this aspect of themselves in an empowering way that aligns with their values and personality. Someone might embrace their "Elegant Icon" energy while another connects with their "Creative Bohemian" or "Regal Presence." The identity should feel inspiring and authentic rather than imposed or imitative.
This category often reveals important information about how clients value themselves. Resistance to naming an appearance identity is common as personal appearance is an indicator of self-worth, self-love, self-care and a reflection of how people manage themselves and the way they show up in the world. Enthusiasm suggests an area of natural strength and joy.

## Leigh Ann's Actual Examples

### Example 1:

_"The next category is personal appearance. This is an area that many people overlook, but it can have a significant impact on your life. Consider: How do you want to be perceived by the world? How do you show up, both in how you look and how you present yourself? In today's world, people often form impressions instantly based on appearanceâ€”sometimes in positive ways, sometimes in negative ways. Your grooming, style, and the way you carry yourself can influence how others respond to you, and also reflect how you care for yourself. It's easy to let this aspect slip by, but being intentional about your personal appearance can be a powerful way to support your identity and goals. For example, you might choose identities like Model, Fit Phenom, Dapper Executive, or Casual Creative."_

### Example 2:

_"um, all right, this is another one that you do very well. And then I encourage you to like, honor yourself with your Identity here, which is your Personal Appearance. Thank you, because Personal Appearance is a category that people have a chance to really like up level in, and the people that are up leveled in, like, their whole life is better, you know? And I think you do this very well, so you get a chance to pick a cool name for your Personal Appearance identity. So I'll tell you mine. Mine is Elegant Icon. And it is how I show up, but also how I keep my home and all of that stuff that's kind of all embodied, encompassed in one"_

### Example 3:

_"Moving on. So this is a really beautiful one. This is another one that really blows people's world open, just considering that they have the opportunity to choose an identity in this category. And this is your personal appearance. How do you want to show up in the world. How do you present yourself? What do you want the world to take in when you walk into a room?"_
