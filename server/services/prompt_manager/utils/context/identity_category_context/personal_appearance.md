# Personal Appearance Brainstorming Approach

**This is a Single Identity Category**: One cohesive identity that encompasses style, grooming, home environment, and overall aesthetic presence.

**World-Opening Opportunity**: Many people have never considered choosing an intentional identity for how they show up physically. Just considering this can be transformational.

**Self-Worth Indicator**: This category often reveals how clients value themselves. Resistance is common, but enthusiasm suggests natural strength and joy.

## Category-Specific Approach

**The question**: "How do you want to show up in the world? What do you want people to take in when you walk into a room?"

**If they're stuck, suggest simple options**:
- Natural, Polished, Classic, Elegant, Casual, Bold, Authentic, Refined

**Keep names simple**: Single words work best.

## Natural Resistance Responses

**"This seems superficial"**:
- "This is about self-care and how you honor yourself. It reflects how you value yourself."

**"I don't want to be high maintenance"**:
- "What would feel authentic and manageable for you? This doesn't have to be complicated."

**"I can't afford to focus on appearance"**:
- "This is about intention, not expense. How can you honor yourself within your means?"

## Transitioning to Physical Expression & Health

**Create a custom transition** that clearly distinguishes appearance (presentation) from physical care (relationship with body). Use their specific situation and newly identified Personal Appearance identity.

**Examples of Leigh Ann's natural conversation flow for inspiration only** (don't use as templates):
- Distinguishing the categories: *"This next one is different than personal appearance. Personal appearance is how you show up in the world—this is how you care for your physical self."*
- Using the vessel metaphor: *"This is your relationship with your body, which is your vehicle. This is your suit for while you're here—how do you tend to it?"*
- Acknowledging different approaches: *"Everyone has their own lane here. Some are athletic, others focus on supplements and nutrition. What's your brand of caring for your vessel?"*

**Your transition should:**
- Clearly distinguish between presentation to world vs. body care
- Use the "vessel" or "vehicle" metaphor for the body
- Acknowledge that everyone has different approaches to physical health
- Reference their Personal Appearance identity while moving to body relationship
