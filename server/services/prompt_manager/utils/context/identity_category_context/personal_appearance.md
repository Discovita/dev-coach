- **Personal Appearance:**

  - *Explanation:* How do you want to show up in the world? Not just physically, but in how you present yourself. This shapes the first impression people have of you.
  - *Examples:* "professional," "stylish person," "confident presenter," "trendsetter."
  - *Leigh Ann's style (inspiration):* "Personal Appearance is about how you want to present yourself to the world â€“ how you show up. It's about the impression you make."
