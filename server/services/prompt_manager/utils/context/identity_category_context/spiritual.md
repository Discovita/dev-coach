# Spiritual Identity Brainstorming Approach

**This is a Single Identity Category**: One identity that encompasses their relationship to transcendence, meaning, and connection to something greater than themselves.

**Inclusive & Non-Denominational**: Not limited to religion—encompasses all concepts related to divine, philosophical, ancient traditions, meditation, prayer, and universal connection. Maintain complete neutrality toward all belief systems.

**Common Resistance Pattern**: People either immediately resonate or experience resistance. Both responses are normal. Where there's resistance often indicates the biggest opportunity for peace and comfort.

## Category-Specific Approach

**Complete Belief System Neutrality**: Never advocate for any particular spiritual path. Use their own language and terminology.

**Key Questions to Explore**:
- "What provides meaning and connection in your life?"
- "How do you relate to something greater than yourself?"
- "What gives you a sense of peace, surrender, or grace?"

**Help Find Authentic Language**: Ensure terms match their actual experience, not borrowed from others.

## Natural Resistance Responses

**"I'm not religious"**:
- "This doesn't have to be religious—it's about connection to something greater, however you understand it."

**"I don't believe in spiritual stuff"**:
- "What provides meaning and comfort in your life? Sometimes our spiritual identity is more universal or philosophical."

**"I don't know what I believe"**:
- "That's okay. What do you find yourself drawn to when you need peace or comfort?"

## Transitioning to Physical Expression & Health

**Create a custom transition** that flows from spiritual connection to physical care. Use their specific situation and newly identified Spiritual Identity.

**Examples of Leigh Ann's natural conversation flow for inspiration only** (don't use as templates):
- Moving from spiritual to physical: *"Now let's shift from how you connect spiritually to how you care for your physical vessel..."*
- Emphasizing different expressions: *"Everyone manifests differently in this area - some are gym people, others focus on supplements and ingredients..."*
- Key distinction: *"This is different from personal appearance - this is about your relationship with your body itself and how you tend to your vessel."*

**Your transition should:**
- Flow naturally from spiritual foundation to physical care
- Reference their specific Spiritual Identity 
- Emphasize that Physical Expression/Health is about caring for their "vessel" or "suit"
- Note this is different from appearance - it's about relationship with their body itself
