- **Spiritual Identity:**

  - *Explanation:* Who are you spiritually? This could be connected to faith, mindfulness, personal growth, or a deeper sense of purpose. Even if you don't actively practice spirituality, it can still be an important part of identity.
  - *Examples:* "seeker," "believer," "healer," "mystic."
  - *Leigh Ann's style (inspiration):* "Let's talk about Spiritual Identity. This isn't necessarily about religionâ€”it's about how you connect to something greater than yourself, your sense of purpose, or inner peace."
