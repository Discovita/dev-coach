Spiritual Connection

The spiritual category addresses the client's relationship to transcendence, meaning, and connection to something greater than themselves. This identity is not limited to religion but encompasses all concepts related to the divine, philosophical, ancient traditions, meditation, and prayer. Many things can be considered here. In our modern world, we lack surrender, softness and a chance to put down all the pressures of life—the spiritual identity reflects your perspective on this critical part of life. This can encompass everything from "Universe's Child" to "Sacred Activist" to "Mystical Healer."  

Some clients immediately resonate with spiritual identities while others experience resistance or uncertainty. The coach should normalize both responses while encouraging exploration of what provides meaning and connection in the client's life. Sometimes the spiritual identity emerges through other categories, such as viewing their "Mother" or "Healer" role as fundamentally spiritual.

The language used for spiritual identities often requires particular attention to find terms that feel authentic rather than borrowed or imposed. Clients should be encouraged to explore all possibilities—whether traditional religious terminology, unconventional expressions, philosophical concepts, or ancient wisdom traditions—to find what matches their actual experience and opens them to connection with something greater.  


## Leigh Ann's Actual Examples

### Example 1:

_"The next one is Spiritual. So we really recommend that everyone consider an identity in all of the different categories. And if you don't have one, it's okay. But also know that, like, that's your biggest chance to kind of up level your life, like, where you have resistance, or whatever, like, a lot of people have resistance to the Physical Appearance one, obviously not you, but, but the spiritual one is definitely something that if you don't have, as you work forward through the exercises of the process, you realize like, 'Oh, I do need this.' And if you don't have one, all good. And if you do, it also doesn't have to be religious, right? Like, it can be, whoo, it can be, like, I did this work, this thing with a bunch of Russians, and they, like, just so easily, were like, 'Oh, I'm Universe's Child'."_

### Example 2:

_"The next one is I find, well, I mean, it could be quagmire as well. It was a quagmire for me, but I find that people, people either are like a yes or no on, or they're like, they have one, or they don't. And if they don't, then it's something to consider. But it's spiritual identity, okay, um, you know, it doesn't necessarily have to be religious right, but, but it has to do with and what we find, I find that people that don't have one, they don't have a spiritual identity. When we get to the later work, you realize that it's something that's dramatically missing. Like most of the people that don't have a spiritual identity are really lacking peace. They're lacking comfort. They're lacking the soothing of their life. And so and I had this really amazing experience where I did this exercise with a couple of Russian women who just very easily chose something kind of universal, like, Oh, I'll be the universe's child. Like, that will be my, that's my spiritual identity. And it was kind of like, Oh, great."_

### Example 3:

_"Okay, this next one is really cool. It is, it is a, it. You know, this one can be tricky for people. Either they're totally in or they're totally out, but it's the same thing you can kind of have, not having it is a is a hole in your life. And I'll be someone, I'll tell you I'm someone who doesn't or didn't, and that the more work I do myself, the more I realize, and it's spiritual. Your spiritual identity, right? So this can be everything from like the Austin Woo to, you know, religious to whatever, but it is this sense of peace, surrender, Grace, which most of us Americans at this point don't have."_
