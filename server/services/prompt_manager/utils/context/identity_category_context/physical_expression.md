This category encompasses the client's relationship with their body, health practices, and physical capabilities. It might include identities like "Bio-Hacker," "Intuitive Athlete," "Holistic Level Up Huntress," or "Embodied Wellness Guide."

The coaching exploration should distinguish between appearance-focused and health-focused energies, as these often serve different functions. While Personal Appearance addresses external presentation, Physical Expression relates to internal vitality, strength, and bodily awareness.

Some clients naturally excel in this area while others experience resistance or avoidance. The coach should help identify what aspects of physical health feel most inspiring and sustainable for the individual, avoiding one-size-fits-all approaches to wellness and fitness.

## Leigh Ann's Actual Examples

### Example 1:

_"Okay, so the next one is, kind of, is your physical expression health? So this manifests in people in a lot of different ways. I mean, you've got the like, Jock dudes who are like, Jim crows, right? You've got the girls who are like, look, I will never set foot in a gym, but I'm all about the ingredients and the supplements and the this and that, and so it's kind of like, how do you care for your temp? What's your brand of caring for your vessel that you live inside? And that's different than the personal appearance, which is like, how do I show up in the world is like, do I care for my physical self? And"_

### Example 2:

_"Okay, Physical Expression/Health. So this is like, this is your Bio-Hacker, although you put it in your other thing, it could also be here. This is also Athlete. Like everyone kind of manifests differently in this way, like, what is your Physical Expression? And maybe it is the Bio-Hacker. Maybe it's some sort of, maybe it's some sort of other thing, but it's kind of like, how do you physically show up in the world, and how do you care for and relate to your body as, you know, different than the physical appearance, which is kind of like your presentation to the world. This is kind of your relationship with your body itself and your maintenance of it."_

### Example 3:

_"Okay, um, this next one is physical expression, health. So this one kind of manifests in people. It's different than than personal appearance, right? This is your physical the way that you care for your body, which is your vehicle. This is your suit for while you're here, you know, how do you end to it? You know? And, and everyone has a kind of different way. Like, obviously, I mean, I'm a very athletic person. My partner is, like, extremely athletic, right? So, like, ours tends towards the athletic fitness side. There are other people like, you know, I know some girls who, like, will never go to a gym ever a day in their life, but they're, like, really big on all their supplements and their food and, like, their, you know, their skin care and, like, you know, whatever. So, like, everyone kind of has their own lane here, but it is very important to tend to your vessel and, and, and, who, who? Who are you in that category?"_
