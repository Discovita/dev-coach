Familial Relations

This category addresses how clients show up in family relationships, whether biological, chosen, or symbolic. The identity might be literal, such as "Mother," "Sister," or "Daughter," or more archetypal, such as "Family Anchor" or "Generational Healer."

Clients with strong family connections might identify multiple familial identities, but the coach should explore with them if there is one energy that encompasses all. If not, they can absolutely have more in this area. Most people will find one sufficient but some may choose mother and daughter etc. because both roles are significant in their life. Sometimes a single identity like "Sister" can encompass how someone wants to relate to parents, siblings, children, and extended family members.

For clients with complicated family relationships, this category might initially produce resistance. The coach can explore symbolic or aspirational approaches, such as becoming the "Mother" to their inner child or choosing "Wise Elder" energy regardless of chronological age.

## Leigh Ann's Actual Examples

### Example 1:

_"So, familial relation, so you had on there already on your list. You had, you know, husband, uh, brother. What did you have? You had husband, father and brother? So, so some people find that one familial relation is sufficient for them in their lives. Like I've had a lot of people choose sister, and that's even how they want to show up in a relationship with their parents. Now I've chose mother because that's also the way that I I chose empowered mother for myself. That's also the way I need to show up in my family of origin, even like I'll need the mothering that we never got. No, yeah, and so that for me, but, but there are people who have a very robust and rich family life who do find more that there's more than one familial identity for them, like, you know, maybe it's father, maybe, maybe there is something more."_

### Example 2:

_"okay, familial relation. So this is how you show up in your family of origin, or in your community, or in your chosen you know, your family. I'll tell you that this is another one people. Some people have really strong ties. Choose, um, choose to have more than one here, which is totally welcome, depending or one like, I'll tell you, mine is empowered mother. It's how I want to show up for my future children, and also how I want to show up in my family of origin, because we didn't have that. That's why I can show up and be the Empowered Mother in my family."_

### Example 3:

_"So this one, actually, I - obviously you have a bunch of these, so this one's Familial Relation. So you have mom, or you have, in, I heard you do three of them, like Mom, Sister and Daughter, right? And so, you know, you're obviously someone who has very strong family ties, which is beautiful. And so you get to decide if you want to have multiple Identities for family if, you know, you want to choose one for the sake of like, ‘this embodies how I relate to everyone’. Maybe it's Sister, maybe it's Mother, maybe it's you know you or if you say, like, look, 'I'm Mother’, ‘I'm a Mother and a Daughter and those are both important for me'."_
