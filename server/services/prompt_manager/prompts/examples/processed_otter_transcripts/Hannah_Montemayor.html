<section><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>0:07</div><div>Okay, I have wife, dog, mom, sister, daughter, friend, realtor, general contractor, athlete, bio hacker.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>0:15</div><div>I love it. Okay, yes, you are. I</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>0:19</div><div>don't know if there's anything else I can think of right now. Designer, it</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>0:23</div><div>doesn't matter. Only it's only, oh yeah. Designer, it's only the first prompt. There's more. Okay,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>0:29</div><div>great, don't,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>0:30</div><div>don't worry. You don't have to exhaust yourself on this one. Okay, so the next one is, who do you aspire to be? What do you think that like? Maybe you're not now, but it would be really great if I was a millionaire. It would be really great if I was a mother. It would be if I was whatever. So we're going to now do the reaches. What do I want to be?</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>0:55</div><div>Okay? I want to be a</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:09</div><div>multi millionaire. Great.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:11</div><div>I love it.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:17</div><div>Um, earlier, I was telling my mom how I'm not concerned about making a million dollars at all. And she couldn't compute because of her own story lines in her head. She was like, What do you mean? I was like, No, serious. I'm not concerned about it in the slightest. Yeah. I watched her try to try to grasp, but it was kind of a cute conversation</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>1:37</div><div>there. Yeah, yeah.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:38</div><div>And I was like, seriously, I could do it easily if I wanted to. I just need to do it. Okay, yeah, the nice thing is that I'm the majority of the things that I want to be. Let me see Car Wash owner,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:59</div><div>oh, you're all about Cody's, like boring businesses.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>2:03</div><div>Yeah, we're working on we just put together our pro forma, and we have it out to the investors that we've chosen to work with, and we're about to get the land for it, so we're on our way, and then that'll allow me to be very present with my children and to be a multi millionaire someday. It's a great, boring business. Um, let me see. What else do I want to be a multi millionaire mom, Car Wash owner? Let me think. I know there's other things I</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>2:45</div><div>this also isn't the last prompt, so if you feel complete, also good. Okay?</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>3:14</div><div>I Okay. It's flowing now.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>3:17</div><div>Yes, I love it. I really</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>3:19</div><div>want to be an adoptive mom.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>3:22</div><div>Oh, yeah, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>3:24</div><div>I'd love to adopt a kid or be a foster parent. Okay?</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>3:38</div><div>Emily compound steward, hmm, um,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>3:47</div><div>great. So, so that was like a beautiful maximalist list, and some of them are going to be kind of related, right, and and conceptually, they can kind of nest under each other. So keep that in mind as we move forward, because we are doing, like a big list. But the goal is eventually to have like the perfect size where you can focus on all of them and they feels like they cover all of you. But for example, for me, I did like Chef kind of went under my healer. Like, I use healer.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>4:25</div><div>That's great, nice,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>4:31</div><div>okay, you know, so, so I kind of nest, and then I had, like, warrior and dancer and athlete, and I was kind of like, I am all these things. And like, I think for me at that time, like warrior embodied all of them, and I chose warrior to present all of that energy in my life. And so as we go through the next exercise, you're going to get to pick which ones kind of prevail, if you will, and which ones are going to kind of be the the star of the show, even if the under, even if the adoptive mother is there, maybe the arc identity is mother, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>5:13</div><div>right, okay, um,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>5:15</div><div>and then you'll also have a chance To after we get off, is really, like, kind of think into, like, what's a really fun name for it? Like, is it mother, or is it like, abundant Earth Queen? I don't know you know what I'm saying, but really be poetic with it.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>5:38</div><div>Yeah, yeah. And</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>5:40</div><div>really, like, have a title for this part of you that's so important. And you know what? It what? What's so beautiful about this exercise is that you know everyone, when they try to think of their life, they actually think of the exterior buckets like family and finance and work and this and instead of bringing it within you, it's like, who am I in relation? What is my relationship to those things? Who am I like, my identity towards work? How do I show up in work? How do I show up in family? How do I show up in those and when you bring the understanding inside of you and the origin inside of you. It makes it much more relatable and meaningful. Does that make sense?</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>6:32</div><div>Yeah, it, I mean, it does kind of, could you say it to me again in another way so I can grasp it better?</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>6:39</div><div>So what I'm saying is that, like when most people are talking about their life, if you're thinking about your whole life, right, your people are thinking about these exterior buckets, like family, work, but when you say, Mother, entrepreneur, bring it inside yourself, it's all things that you are that are important to you, instead of these arbitrary exterior things you maybe do or don't care about, sure, sure. Does that make sense? Yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>7:08</div><div>right. Like, honestly, like, I don't care about the title business owner or contractor, or I don't care about their title, REALTOR at all, or contractor at all, but I do care about the title of like, business owner, you know, like, right? Yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>7:26</div><div>and job is to choose something that excites you, that fucking fire up to get out there, and and, and maybe contractor and realtor and all those are just under your business woman or or abundant queen or whatever the bucket is. You know what I mean, like, however you want to couch it, so that you know when you're going to do this, when you're going to do realtor work, or where you're going to show up for Planet Fitness, like you're showing abundant Queen energy, because that's what you're doing. I like</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>7:58</div><div>it. I could, I could definitely use that. Yeah, you know that</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>8:05</div><div>cool. So</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>8:07</div><div>okay, so I'm gonna start. So your job now is to start like, you can whittle your list a little bit if you feel like, Man, this is not something that's super important, but this is exciting. And then we're also going to go through some recommended categories, and at the end, we're going to kind of come up with your perfect constellation. Cool. Sound good, yep. All right, so, um, the very first category is, kind of is your passion. So these are the things that make you uniquely you. They're kind of your personality, things your whatever, your skills that you've developed, things you like, like people who are musicians or bookworms or designers or whatever so. And this is a multiple category. You can choose as many as you want, but again, you don't want, like, 10, you know, but things that are your passions that kind of define you. And I would say that there's one that I haven't seen on there that I think really defines you. What is it that I'm cheating? Because I know you, I just think that, like you're a meticulous executor, thank you, or something like that, you know, like you got your your buttoned up. Yes,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>9:31</div><div>you know, yes, yes, I am. Actually, I was just complimented for that earlier. Um, you know what? Actually, now that you think you know that you say that, that is probably I get two, like, two top compliments, and one of them I don't like, and the other one I do like. I do like. When people compliment me and tell me that I'm meticulous, that's my top two. The other one that I get that I'm like, Oh, I wish people didn't know me for this. Everybody says you're such a such a hard worker. Like, yeah, right, right. Like, is that what I want to translate? I don't know. Meticulous. Yes. Meticulous, yes. Um, thank you. I'll take that. Um, yeah, and</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>10:16</div><div>here, or there's another category. But I just think that that's like a part of you that you like everything you do is clean, you know?</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>10:26</div><div>Thanks, yes, I agree with that.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>10:32</div><div>Now I'm looking on there</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>10:34</div><div>your passions and things that make you unique. Leigh, you Yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>10:43</div><div>uh, well, I put designer, because that's what I'm honestly impressed at that. Um,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>10:52</div><div>I'm extremely</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>10:55</div><div>good at communication.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>10:58</div><div>Great. Put so would</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>10:59</div><div>that be something? Communicator,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>11:01</div><div>sure, yeah. Also, again, there's nothing set in stone. We're just kind of like playing around with stuff right now, and in the end, we can cross, we can add, we can whatever.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>11:16</div><div>I don't know how I would put this, but I'm extremely good at being healthy,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>11:24</div><div>yes, but that's your that's your biohacker, and I would say that's part of your kind of interest. Yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>11:31</div><div>yeah, yeah. It's like, you</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>11:33</div><div>better name if you want. Mm, hmm. I'm</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>11:46</div><div>going to call myself a health aficionado.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>11:56</div><div>The other thing is that it's hard to think of these things like right now, when you leak, let this start to trickle, like, down into your system. Um, you'll come up with those cool names.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>12:12</div><div>I like it, yeah.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>12:19</div><div>So yeah, I would say the bio, bio hacker, or whatever you choose to call that, yeah, oh,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>12:24</div><div>yeah, designer, meticulous, execute or communicator, yeah.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>12:28</div><div>I don't know if there's</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>12:29</div><div>anything else that I feel like I need to list there, except for, I mean, like, yeah. I mean, that's fine with me. I'm great at keeping relationships, so but I don't know if I need to add that,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>12:43</div><div>like your communicator too, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>12:44</div><div>yeah. And</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>12:45</div><div>we have a lot of relationship stuff that comes up later. So cool,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>12:49</div><div>cool. Then I feel pretty good about these things.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>12:51</div><div>Okay, so we still have so the next category is the maker of money. Who is your maker of money? And this is a really good question for you right now, as you step into this new frontier, is like, who is your maker of money? Like, is it, is it an entrepreneur? Is that the eventual goal and or is it a is it a meticulous organizer? Is it like, who is making the money? And the question is about, like, through what do you channel your energy that's going to inspire you when you go to make money? And it's kind of the thing, like, realtor, like, what you're saying is, I kind of don't want to do this as my I don't want real to be my maker of money. I'm kind of over it at the moment.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>13:40</div><div>Pam, yeah, yeah, you</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>13:42</div><div>do, yeah. And I'll tell you, I like to explain about mine a little so I am. I have an entrepreneur that's my maker of money because, like, I'm completely unemployable, and I just do my own thing, you know? And so my maker of money is my entrepreneur. However, many of the jobs that need to get done to make money are done by my Creator. Like, I'm a creative person, and I make all sorts of ideas, marketing plans, programs, what apps like. So I'm a maker. I'm a creator. And a lot of my work that earns me money, my my creative mind is actually doing, but that's because it's more inspiring a creator than to and like my entrepreneur, the stuff that my entrepreneur does is like, sign the contracts,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>14:42</div><div>yeah, yeah, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>14:45</div><div>yeah, hire someone like the executive does those things. But my Creator is the one who's developing this program. My Creator is the one who's finding and hiring the designer, like, so when you're done with I'm jumping ahead a little, but when you're done with this, you're gonna have, like, a whole team that you can deploy in your life, of your best selves to go out and crush,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>15:12</div><div>yeah, I mean, so who's my money maker? I mean the money maker that. So it would fall between the designer and the meticulous executor. Honestly, it's, it's a mix of those two roles, because, like, and maybe I could just air this out to you, because I've noticed it, and I find it interesting, and I'm putting thought into it lately. Is something that I've noticed is my meticulous executor is something that people notice about me and appreciate and trust in me to do work, but my designer is the thing that, like holes work into me. I get, I get really easy money flow when it comes through me being able to exercise things from a design standpoint, because it's what light, lights me up the most. I'm really good at executing things. It just doesn't like stoke my fire, but it's what people know. I</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>16:25</div><div>already know. I already know what we're doing with this. So the answer your maker of money is your designer. Because you're being a designer when you sell the houses, when you imagine the houses, when you do whatever, some of the work gets done by the meticulous executor, right? But that's actually going to go in a different category, like the maker of money is</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>16:48</div><div>my designer. It is, yeah, and it is to go do</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>16:51</div><div>this contracting work. You're going to do this project management. You're designing the flow,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>16:58</div><div>yeah, the only thing I care about in my career is that I am in charge of designing something that happens to become something physically for people to enjoy. And so, okay, so my money maker is my designer, and I know that my goal in my career, at some point, is that I stopped doing everything that I'm doing right now and design textiles. Yeah, someday I just want to be a literal designer.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>17:25</div><div>Yeah, I love it. Okay,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>17:28</div><div>great.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>17:29</div><div>So designer also, it can change, like you can evolve. The great thing about this is, like, we aren't static. We are always changing and growing. So you might wake up in a few days, and it might not be a designer, it might be someone else that's making the money, and you have permission to change and,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>17:46</div><div>you know. But I like that. I think that that's right, that's</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>17:52</div><div>right. Yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>17:55</div><div>great. It is. Yeah.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>17:56</div><div>Are great already eye opening, yeah.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>17:59</div><div>I mean, it's something like, I, I knew it, but it's really valuable to look because my logical mind wants to be like, no, let it be your meticulous executor and your entrepreneur that makes you money. But really, the only money that like, really, it's like, I have to, like, clench on that. And it doesn't really come to me. And then as soon as I sit back and I like, just do design oriented dining. Oh, my God, it's just like, yeah, so thanks. This is true. Yeah.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>18:30</div><div>I love it. Okay, so I have another exciting paradigm shifting question, who is your keeper of money, because the maker of money is one energy and one vibe and set of activities, and the keeper of money is a totally different vibe and set of activities,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>18:58</div><div>yeah. So actually, while we were talking in our passions, point, I actually went back into my I am and and I added good housekeeper. And good housekeeper too, good housekeeper, yeah, to me, that means more than just my literal home. That means my financial house and my family's financial house, and so that is my good. Um, my good. Actually, I live on the money keeper finances. Yeah, like this is, this is me in a board on my financial housekeeper. So behind me, I literally have paid off, paid off keeping this, do this by the end of year, do this, get these filed. And it's completely in my like home keeping mode that I do that and I execute. And as soon as I do it this way, I I allocate money extremely well. I leave it to my creative</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>20:12</div><div>housekeeper. Or is it like a castle keeper? Oh,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>20:16</div><div>I like that so much. Um,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>20:20</div><div>like, an estate keeper, or, like, what is it that's kind of like, housekeeper, like, yes, but like, what be more exciting? Bigger Yeah, I</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>20:31</div><div>like that. It's so much more fun when you think about it in bigger, bigger terms. Uh,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>20:48</div><div>is the word Empire Builder just came to me. But I also like my maybe home, maybe, maybe Castle keeper and Empire Builder are too different. Why</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>21:01</div><div>don't you? I mean, look again, we're just, this is a brainstorming exercise, so write them both down, and you just get to let it sink into the groundwater over the next, you know, couple of days, because also, this is an exercise for the subconscious that takes place in the conscious mind, and then you got to let</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>21:24</div><div>it marinade. Yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>21:32</div><div>I'm gonna light my sub. Can subconscious reprogramming candle. I have one right here.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>21:42</div><div>I'll be right back. Let me just</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>21:46</div><div>I try to have a ritual. I've been doing it since December 31 of lighting my subconscious reprogramming candle every time I'm doing it. So it's like a trigger. Okay, who keeps my money? My castle I like Castle keeper. I like the alliteration there, um and Empire Builder. They they are similar, and I'll come up with a name that meshes them together. The reason why they're similar but different is Castle keeper feels like it's me growing money for my entire family. An Empire Builder feels like it's very solo, driven, you know, like one feels like ego based, and the other feels like I want to, like, do something for my family. So I'll sit with that, yeah, sit with</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>22:38</div><div>it, and you might come up with something totally different. But, and I love the housekeeping, and housekeeping is, like, really important. And I think that when it comes to, like, your keeper of money, you don't want it to be like small bean counting,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>22:53</div><div>no, no, no. You want</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>22:55</div><div>it to be expansive.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>22:56</div><div>Yeah. So I mean, and that would be my empire builder. My Empire Builder is the one that thinks forward to everything I need to do to obviously build an empire. So, yeah, okay, great.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>23:09</div><div>Paper could come up later. I have another I have another idea for it as we exercise. All</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>23:17</div><div>right, okay, great,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>23:18</div><div>um, all right, this is another one that you do very well. And then I encourage you to like, honor yourself with your identity here, which is your personal appearance. Thank you, because personal appearance is a category that people have a chance to really like up level in, and the people that are up leveled in, like, their whole life is better, you know? And I think you do this very well, so you get a chance to pick a cool name for your personal appearance identity. So I'll tell you mine. Mine is elegant icon. Yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>23:59</div><div>that's accurate, and</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>24:01</div><div>it is how I show up, but also how I keep my home and all of that stuff that's kind of all embodied, encompassed in one</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>24:16</div><div>that's a very accurate. It's funny, you say that, and I'm like, Yes, I can picture that</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>24:31</div><div>something that some that is commonly used to describe me, so I always found interesting because it's really specific, is the word regal.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>24:41</div><div>I love the word regal.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>24:44</div><div>Yeah, so I'm</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>24:53</div><div>just thinking some some intoxicated person recently told me that they felt nervous around me because they thought I looked like the President of the United States and that, and I thought that was such a compliment. They were like, you just have presidential energy, and I don't like, I feel bad for being drunk. And I was like,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>25:14</div><div>great,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>25:15</div><div>that's right,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>25:18</div><div>if you're sloppy and drunk, don't hang out. Don't</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>25:21</div><div>hang out with Hannah. She'll make you feel self conscious about your life choices. Okay, so can you</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>25:29</div><div>write regal as like a stem, and then we can turn it into a noun,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>25:37</div><div>appearance, identity. I not all</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>25:53</div><div>that I know why the term business in the front, party in the back is coming to me. It's because my life is significantly split between like, like I I'm wearing a button up right now, but I have a bin of burning mine clothes next to me,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>26:15</div><div>yeah, including funny years and like, whatever else,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>26:19</div><div>yeah, like, flowy stuff right there, so let me go with</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>26:40</div><div>creative would be A word that I use for that, because I am very creative when I'm Chloe, creative regal. Creative regal queen. That's where I'm at so far. Do you have any suggestions</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>26:58</div><div>you're gonna noodle on it? I think it's great. I don't, I think, I think you're it's going to come to you. You'll have an aha moment.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>27:05</div><div>Yeah, I will. I'll let you know when I do. Okay,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>27:09</div><div>cool. Also, just, you know, I'm doing the like speed through version as a test. So that's why we're all right, on to the next great The next one is spiritual. So we really recommend that everyone consider an identity in all of the different categories. And if you don't have one, it's okay. But also know that, like, that's your biggest chance to kind of up level your life, like, where you have resistance, or whatever, like, a lot of people have resistance to the physical appearance one,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>27:40</div><div>obviously</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>27:41</div><div>not you, but, but the spiritual one is definitely something that if you don't have, as you work forward through the exercises of the process, you realize like, Oh, I do need this.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>27:55</div><div>And</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>27:58</div><div>if you don't have one, all good. And if you do, it also doesn't have to be religious, right? Like, it can be, whoo, it can be, like, I did this work, this thing with a bunch of Russians, and they, like, just so easily, were like, Oh, I'm universe's child. I was like,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>28:16</div><div>That's really cute, universe's child,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>28:22</div><div>you're also welcome to steal other people's great ones if you want, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>28:25</div><div>that's that is great. Um, it's</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>28:28</div><div>just so easy and non controversial. And I think it's because they're like, have any Yeah, religion, so they don't have all the like, messy stuff, like, we,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>28:41</div><div>yeah, I'm Oh, I got it. Omni believer. Healer, Oh, I</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>28:52</div><div>love it. Yes, my healer, for a long time, was in my my spiritual and then I'm starting to sprout a spiritual one, but I realized like, Oh, I've got a lot of trauma in there. That's why I'm not, you know, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>29:08</div><div>yeah, yeah, I do know Omni believer. You or it's</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>29:22</div><div>mouthful. All the new believer. Healer, feeler,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>29:25</div><div>yeah.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>29:28</div><div>And again you get to, this is just round one. You're gonna let them trickle in over you're gonna,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>29:34</div><div>yeah, what was that universe's child?</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>29:37</div><div>Yeah, that's cute.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>29:39</div><div>I like that. And write down.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>29:55</div><div>Yeah, okay, great, okay, amazing.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>29:59</div><div>Um, where are we? Okay, physical expression health. So this is like, like, this is your bio hacker, although you put it in your other thing, it could also be here. This is also athlete. Like everyone kind of manifests differently in this way, like, what is your physical expression? And maybe it is the bio hacker. Maybe it's some sort of, maybe it's some sort of other thing, but it's kind of like, how do you physically show up in the world, and how do you care for and relate to your body as you know, different than the physical appearance, which is kind of like your presentation to the world. This is kind of your relationship with your body itself and your maintenance of it. Mm, hmm.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>31:08</div><div>The first word that comes to mind is wholeness, because I have, like an inn adverse reaction toward, like, shortcuts or things that aren't actually good for me, you know, like, I've, I've, I've always opted to take the long route if it's full of whole foods, whole whole foods, and real hard work and like, I'll do that all, all, all day, every day. I also have almost never eaten non organic or like grass fed food in my entire life. So</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>31:50</div><div>I'm low maintenance. But like, was that cooked in a stainless steel pan and fed? And where is this water distilled? And</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>31:59</div><div>I know even I'm like,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>32:01</div><div>in this car seat,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>32:03</div><div>literally it, you know, it comes into everything. But then I also drive a battery, so I know it's one of those things. Um, yeah, okay, let me see</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>32:18</div><div>my physical express my identity is</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>32:40</div><div>I mean biohacker is easy.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>32:46</div><div>Now it kind of, this is where you have some creative license. Like, do you have a physical expression and you're a biohacker? Or is biohacker kind of embody your physical expression? You know, it's kind of your choice. Like, I found that people are either, like, super athletic and that that's like, their focus and their thing, and then they're also a bio hacker, and that's kind of a passion. There's people that are like, like, you know, my friend who I met with the other day, she's a lawyer, and she's like, like, I don't work out, but like, I'm super fucking healthy and no, like, non toxic, and I research everything. And like, that's my health niche, is my exposures and my ingestions. And like, that's how I take care of myself. Like, I'm just like, I'm a chick, and I don't have any muscles and I don't want them, you know, like that, I</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>33:36</div><div>would go, I would go absolutely bonkers if I didn't work out five times a week.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>33:41</div><div>Okay? But, you know, she Yeah, and we were, she was just talking about her life, and she's like, you know, she was saying her man is, like, super athletic and all this stuff, but she's the one who's like, did you read the label on that?</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>33:56</div><div>Well, I'm definitely more athletic than I mean, like, I naturally lean toward Whole Foods. I do everything I'm gonna I'm gonna go for I labeled myself. I feel like this name feels kind of out there, but I'm going for it. Um, holistic, level up. Huntress, oh, because I'm a constant, I'm hunting for new, new ways to level myself up, and I'm constantly hunting for them. And so that feels right, but, yeah, okay, great. I like it. Do it?</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>34:33</div><div>Yeah? Um, okay, so this one, actually, I obviously you have a bunch of these, so this one's familial relation. So you have mom, or you have, in, I heard you do three of them, like mom, sister and daughter, right? And so, you know, you're obviously someone who has very strong family ties, which is beautiful. And so you get to decide, like, if you want to have multiple identities for family if you know you want to choose one for the sake of like, this embodies how I relate to everyone. Maybe it's sister, maybe it's mother, maybe it's you know you or if you say, like, look, I'm Mother, I'm a mother and a daughter, and those are both important for me. The final question that we're going to ask is, is this identity integral to my being, and is this something I want to focus on, nurture and pursue, right? And then, if not, like Sister, can nest under daughter, or it can nest under or all of it. Can nest under sister like I have my friend who chose sister as her relating because she was like, I would like to be more sisterly with my mom, and I would be more sisterly with my friends. And this is my kind of relating identity is I would like to be more sisterly so you kind of get creative license there. I don't find that many people who have too many familial identities, so you are very lucky.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>36:07</div><div>Yes, yeah, yeah. I got, I got lots of family,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>36:14</div><div>yeah. And you could all decide, I'll tell you that like I had, like, my personal my family is a disaster. And so I just was like, not gonna have one of those over this family one. And then Eric was telling me, like, I really think you should consider adding mother to your identities, like, blah, blah, blah. And I was like, you know, and then I went through my whole shadow exercise, and I was like, all of my daughter paid a mom,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>36:49</div><div>yeah, you can be your own mom, yeah.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>36:51</div><div>So mine is a mother, because I actually powered mother, even in my family, to bring it together. And so that embodied it all for me. So it doesn't have to be super literal. It can be like what symbolically feels right to you. And on that one, I</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>37:11</div><div>think when you choose sister for a similar reason to your friend, that feels right. I'm also like, I'm really working on the creating relationships with my sister in laws. I have two sister in laws. And, yeah, my sister is my most important relationship right now. And then I even want to be kind of like a sisterly mom. Yeah, you know, you know my mom was a sisterly mom, and it worked out very well. So, yeah, I am kind of sisterly to my mom. Also kind of Mobbed my mom. Sister, sister, great. Cool.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>37:55</div><div>Yeah. Sister, great.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>37:57</div><div>So the next one is romantic relation and or sexual expression.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>38:18</div><div>Wonder what the right word to choose here is</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>38:23</div><div>so I'll tell you that like lover, we've played around with. Lover is kind of the standard, right? And then I kind of was like hopping around on all these things, and at this current moment, it's Princess wife.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>38:36</div><div>I like that. I thought a lot. I feel very much in my princess life era. That's so accurate.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>38:45</div><div>You're totally,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>38:48</div><div>may I, because that is so accurate. I'm, like, fully embodied into my princess wife era right now. And it's great. That's a great era. You're</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>39:00</div><div>like, it's working for me. Yes, that's so good.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>39:08</div><div>Yeah. And now, and I'm sorry to rush you through this, but again, no, no, um, the last one is the doer of things. So this is your meticulous executor. This is your housekeeper. This is whatever you are, a fantastic DOER of things. And usually I have to explain to people like, why we need a doer of things, but I don't even think that I need to explain it to you. So</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>39:34</div><div>that's the doer of things. Could take a back seat every once in a while, right?</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>39:39</div><div>So, but here, let's explain how you're going to choose the name of your DOER of things, so that it becomes an elevating experience. Not like it's not a dishwasher, you know, it's not a slave, and it's not someone who's like panic doing in order to save the world. It's</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>40:04</div><div>an</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>40:06</div><div>it's a self validating, self affirming action that you do. And I'll share what mine is. Mine is captain of my life, yeah, and I'm my life, and I execute my duty swiftly and with honor in order to have smooth C's for Sailing my amazing life.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>40:30</div><div>Oh, I like that. Okay. I Hmm, that's good.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>40:50</div><div>Also, we have to accept that, like certain best parts of us are trauma responses,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>40:55</div><div>totally, you know, totally.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>40:58</div><div>I went through this experience at one point where I was like so I had originally chosen warrior, and then I had this realization that like, fucking warrior is a trauma response like that anymore, and I grew, I evolved past it, and I got rid of it. It's not on there anymore. Yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>41:15</div><div>no, it's definitely, definitely an evolution. I've noticed that in myself too. I'm like, I've had like, three very I've actually, literally, because I'm on my third last name, um, yeah, because I had my bio dad's last name until I was 22 and then I didn't resonate with it at all, and so I changed it to my stepdad last name, not knowing that I would get married four and a half years later. So it was a lot of paperwork, but I needed it. I needed off of that. It was like an entire new life chapter. And then as soon as I got my now forever last name, it was just like, okay, stop New Life chapter again. So it's just interesting how that happens. Names are very powerful, and once you stop relating to it, there's no going back. So let me see do the doer of things. How do I want to relate? I have a hard time with them. I don't know I'm like, having a feeling of</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>42:29</div><div>resentment. Maybe is that hard toward like, I think I am resentful of the fact that the most, most people, the first thing they point out is that I am such a good doer of things, instead of, like my flowy side, or my like lover side.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>42:50</div><div>If you don't want to have a doer of things, like we don't have right now, we can actually do the rest of the work. And then all of this stuff becomes clear. You have a lot of resistance, and you have a lot of ickiness in there. Like, you don't have to pick it, like, we can, we can, we can just leave it for a minute and circle back later to when it feels good.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>43:15</div><div>Yeah, sure what it is. It's interesting how I have that like, but it's like, my best. I'm so good at it. It's probably my number one thing that I'm really, really good at. I just like, for some reason don't like. I maybe, maybe it's a trauma response.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>43:33</div><div>Yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>43:36</div><div>sorry. I'll think, Oh no, it's fine. You do your thing. I'll think on it.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>43:42</div><div>So these are all just little, you know, thoughts and ideas to play with in your mind, and the point is to come up with this list that is cohesive, that you feel like, if I can be all these people, I'm going to live like a really badass life, like this is who I want to be, If I can wake up every morning and be these people?</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>44:25</div><div>Yes,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>44:28</div><div>yeah, I'm into it. And I think that, yeah, I think it's actually, it's we've, we've hit on an interesting string that I will sit with. It's, it's funny how I like have a reluctance to naming this part of me, even though it's like, really, a really, really important, prominent role that I played in my life, it's like, it's probably the number one role that I sit in. So it's just, it's just interesting, but it's meant for me. It's messy on that Yeah, and I that wants to hide what's</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>44:59</div><div>really beautiful, yeah, yeah. Well, what I say is, like, when you have resistance to naming one, ooh, that's where all the juicy stuff is. List fucking exposes everything. And it's so great fun, creative project, and like, the way that it changes people's life, just deciding these things, and there's more exercises that will do. But just deciding these things the way it changes people's lives, it's like amazing, because it just seeps into the subconscious and it becomes like acceptable to be the best part of yourself you know and ask, just asking these questions like shifts people you know, and so, and it also, like, it's such a great diagnostic tool. Like, instead of having to, like, dig into someone's guts, you could just ask these questions, and you're like, totally, I know what's happening here,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>45:55</div><div>right? Like, totally. And this is giving me like, this is, this is extremely valuable. So thank you for bringing me to figuring this out. Because I've been so just like, totally candidly lately I've been like, Okay, I've been like, stone cold sober for coming on, like, almost six months at this point, basically, maybe, actually, I think the last time I did anything was that, like, am at your Halloween party or something? I've been like, I was like, sober, sober. So I've been like, sitting with myself a lot, not running for myself. And I'm having this thing where I'm like, Okay, I've done so much work, but there's like, something, something that I can't quite find where I'm having, like, continued feelings of shame that I can't pin, or what, like, maybe like shame or something or like frustration, or like, just like some sort of, like something unpleasant that I like, I haven't been able to find it inside of myself yet. I'm like, I'm doing all like, I'm meditating so much. I know there's, I know there's like, something behind this door with a question mark on it, but I have no idea what it is. And maybe I just found, maybe I just found a little bit of it because I didn't, I had no idea that I had resistance to this.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>47:21</div><div>Oh, yeah, right, yeah. And that's where all the juicy stuff lurks. Like, you can just it's under the card of the identity that you didn't want to name. Like, for me, the family one and the spiritual one. Like, Nope, we're not looking under there. Like,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>47:37</div><div>great. So great, thank you. Yeah.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>47:40</div><div>I want to take a minute and just show you around my thing and kind of show you what else is under the hood. Here you want to look</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>47:47</div><div>please, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>47:51</div><div>let's see. I think there's</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>47:59</div><div>nobody here. I Hannah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>48:03</div><div>are you talking to an animal? My</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>48:05</div><div>dogs? Yeah, they both ran to the door, but there's nobody here. I have them both. I have a pence mat underneath me, and it's super warm and yummy. And they're both laying on it under my feet because they're absorbing the warmth and the healing. Yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>48:20</div><div>it's</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>48:21</div><div><button><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button>cute. Okay, um,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>48:23</div><div><button><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button>okay, so they need to resolve. So this is the identity center. Obviously, this is a bad version. This is not like, this is just, uh, my test beautiful</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>48:37</div><div>to</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>48:39</div><div><button><div> +1 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button><button><div> +1 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button>try out all this stuff, so I'll just read you my identities. So I'm a rooted Oracle, I'm a creator, I'm a magical healer, I'm a successful entrepreneur, I'm a power banker, I'm Ann, I'm an adventurer, I'm an acrobat, I'm a princess wife, I'm an empowered Mother, I'm a connectress, and I'm the captain</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>49:07</div><div>of my life. It's fun. So</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>49:09</div><div><button><div> +3 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button><button><div> +3 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button><button><div> +3 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button><button><div> +3 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button>those are all my categories, and then we create art for each one. And there's kind of like, you have a choice, and I don't know exactly how to delineate this choice of like, what inspires more? But we do. I am statements for each one. Once you're settled like, you gotta sink into your identities, right? But once you've settled on the list, then you create a statement that's like the mission statement of the identity and reinforcing your best self in this character. So I'm inventive and courageous. I use my unique mind and creativity to build things other people only dream of. I believe I can change the world. So I'm constantly experimenting, growing in the healing arts. I use my wisdom to nourish and heal. I manage my money with joy and ease and make power moves to multiply my resources and opportunities in life. I explore the world and venture bravely into the unknown. I leap into all the amazing<button><div> +1 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button><button><div> +1 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button> and new experiences that the world has to offer. I seek to live an extraordinary life. I'm an acrobat, graceful, skilled, strong and flexible. I indulge in movement to play and learn. I'm able to perform for, play with and protect the people I love, anyways. But when you read all of these to yourself about who you are, like, bam,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>50:31</div><div><button><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button>power up.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>50:34</div><div>Okay, I like it.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>50:35</div><div>So this is just the identity module, so it includes art and words, and we can decide what we want to do first art words. I can even share with you the art maker right now. And once you're done, you can or why don't you just get done and tell me, and then we'll all walk you through the art maker, and then you can make all of your pictures like that with your face on them. That's</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>50:56</div><div>super cool. Yeah, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>50:59</div><div>that's the really fun part, and then the I am statements are really important, and what I've been doing with it used to take me forever to do I am statements with my clients. Now I have a chat like, I have a chat bot of me teaching people that has like, chat GPT that helps you write all of your identities like in the way that I want you to write them, like with the in the parameters. It's better than just using mean. We could just use a regular chat module, but it has all of my like previous conversations load in, loaded into it and like it guides you to create this really fast great</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>51:39</div><div>love that that's ideal,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>51:41</div><div><button><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button>compared to doing it like it would take forever if we did when we did it on our like, a long way to, like, writing 12, you know what I mean? Yeah. So, you know, all that resistance that you're finding and the things that are under the hood, that you're like, what the is, all that this is actually and what's really beautiful is like, when you build your dream team, like the best version of yourself, those moments where you know, like, yeah, you have these moments where you notice, like, I am Not being that. Like, yeah, I'm not being the whatever. Like, what am I being? What? Yeah, I'm</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>52:25</div><div>not being the princess wife. I'm being the pessimistic reiterator. Right,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>52:34</div><div><button><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button>right, exactly. So here we do the exact same exercise, led differently, because we actually go through your best self and say, okay, when you're not being this person, who are you being? And it's like, very easy to be like, well, and then we create characters and art, and I am statements for the worst parts of you too. Wow. And it's actually, like, so powerful and revealing and like, helpful. There's this entire wow</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>53:13</div><div><button><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button>that's very confronting, like, I don't something inside of me tingles with, like, a nervousness about it, but it's so valuable?</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>53:21</div><div><button><div> +1 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button><button><div> +1 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button>Yeah. And so you start with like, what are you doing when you're doing that? And you just have to be honest about it. But then we do this alchemization ritual where it's like, what do you what do you need? What are you trying to get with this destructive behavior? Because it's, it's for a reason, it's, it's helping you, and it's giving you a gift, and there's a gift that you need at that time. And so then we develop a way to, like, say, Thank you, damsel in distress, for getting me relief and help. But now I invite the Empowered mother to help me and to help me ask for what I need, you know, and then we also have, like, direct interruptions for when, because you will be like, once you do this work, you'll be like, she's here,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>54:11</div><div>yeah, popping</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>54:12</div><div>everything up, yeah. And then</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>54:16</div><div>you're like, Okay, what do I need? Like, I need a call and ask someone for help. I need to tell somebody that I'm struggling. I need to whatever so we have, like, direct interceptions for And what's crazy is, as soon as you give yourself the gift, actively, all that shit stops, like it stops immediately, like it's like a puppet show, and then it just goes, like,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>54:46</div><div>super valuable, because I find myself, I'm always like, how am I kicking back into that mode, like the avoider mode? Oh, I love avoiding doing things that I know are super easy, but, you know, like, I'm like, how am I falling back into that mode again? I was just motivated, and now I'm not at all. And how do I get myself out of that? What do I do? And then I just spiral, and I drop everything and I take a nap,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>55:08</div><div><button><div> +2 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button><button><div> +2 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button><button><div> +2 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button>right? So this is totally normal. This is human. And by like creating these characters, like the story of your own life. You can see you can call on, you know, the castle builder, or, like, whatever I'm trying to remember, your regal whatever, you can call on these people to bring the energy that you need and when they're not. And there's something else you can realize you know what's actually happening, and you can work together to, like, put out the fire and like this stuff. It's like, super powerful. And then another thing is that we start organizing, and this is not, I've kind of not been using this that much, because right now I'm dreaming about, like, the new way, better one. But you organize all your actions by the identity that's taking the action. So who's going to do it? The connector is going to do it, the designers, but the housekeeper is going to do it. Doesn't even a way. It doesn't even have to be you.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>56:20</div><div>That's so smart, because that's the majority of what I struggle with is like, if I'm in a mode that isn't the right mode or person to be doing the task, I'm like, Why do I absolutely not want to do any of those things right now, although if I was in a different mode, I'd be totally good with doing them and quickly. It seems so obvious, but, you know, I've just been like staring at that problem for so long, but</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>56:50</div><div>this is what I'm creating. This is what I'm awesome,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>56:53</div><div><button><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button>and so making</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>56:55</div><div>it accessible to everyone. Because the thing is, it's magical. But like, who wants to sit with me for hours on Zoom while we ramble about it. I mean, a few people thank God that I've gotten this far. But the truth is is, like making it easier and easier with AI is my like number one goal right now, and that's why I'm kind of practicing, like rushing through it and not being my like, blah, blah, blah. These are all the reasons why.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>57:17</div><div>Mm, hmm, because</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>57:19</div><div>it works when the AI does it more simply. It works fine. Like Wind, long winded, you know? Yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>57:26</div><div>I like your long wind, but I get it. It's also not sustainable. How can you scale if you have to have a four hour meeting every time? It's not sustainable,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>57:33</div><div>but it's not sustainable for the user either. So, yeah, yeah. Okay. And then here, there's one other thing that I want to show you, so you have the really cool artwork for your identities, but this revisions, this is for what you want to experience.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>57:53</div><div>I love that that's so motivating.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>57:57</div><div><button><div> +1 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button><button><div> +1 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button>Create the art and you see what you want, yeah, what you want to experience. And then in here you actually have, like, a whole kind of mission control up to help yourself take action now to be on the road. Yeah. And then there's in charge, who's in charge of doing this? This is what they're going to experience. Okay, these are all the things we're gonna do. Yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>58:26</div><div>I love this.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>58:29</div><div>Yeah, wow, amazing.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>58:34</div><div>That's super rad. Good job. Good job.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>58:41</div><div>Thanks. Yeah, I think, I think it's, it has a chance to be really, really, really epic.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>58:49</div><div>It's so streamlined that's like,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>58:54</div><div>that's what all it does, like, streamline your growth. Yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>58:56</div><div>yes, but that's like multiple different forms of therapy that like that would take you, like, six years to get through, if you did all the different forms of therapy to come up to that conclusion,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>59:12</div><div>dude, and it works like it's so effective, like it's So</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>59:18</div><div>like it's it's basically ifs, like, summed up.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>59:22</div><div>It's ifs of success, instead of like, your internal family systems of trauma. It's like creating your internal family systems of success, smart. It's Eric's idea, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>59:37</div><div>yeah. He was mentioning it to me. He um, yeah, I love it. And yeah, I love it. He showed me his, he showed me kind of his. I am statements and</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>59:51</div><div>people back. It was</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>59:52</div><div>cute. I know when we were, when we were driving. He's like, I feel like I accidentally keep telling you all my secrets. Yeah, that happens. Yeah. So</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:00:02</div><div>he this is the way he's done his whole life by himself. Inside his head, he has so</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:00:07</div><div>smart to some</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:00:09</div><div>and he told me about it, and he told me about it in this way of like, I'm going to share this really deep part of myself, and like I've never done it before, and I'm a little nervous about it, and I'm listening, and all of a sudden I'm like, Oh, my God. Like, I think that I can make this a commercial product. And he was the last thing I was expecting. He was, like, you would like to take my neuroses and make it a commercial product?</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:00:37</div><div>Yes, yes. That's the majority of, like, highly successful commercial products. It's like came from somebody's, like, interesting programming and responses and uniqueness,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:00:50</div><div>yeah, he could never, kind of envision a he could never envision a process for like, making it like this, like it just for me, I had the whole vision of, like, Oh my God. Like, I could make this, you know, so yeah, and it's</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:01:14</div><div>streamlined. I like it. It's getting</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:01:17</div><div>a lot better. I like, I have this really incredible designer on board. And so</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:01:28</div><div>what's your what is it looking like for you in terms of, like, your launch process? Well,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:01:34</div><div>right now, I've got to raise money, because I'm going to hire this guy who's expensive. And I mean, here's the thing, I'm going to go out and raise money. And I think that, like, if, for some reason, I was feeling really positive about money raising, and I feel like yesterday's stock market crash and everything, like, I feel like everyone, like, tightened the belt a little bit. I just saw a note about some new Trump things. It could recover and be fine, and people will relax. But, like, my friend just got, like, a whole bunch of companies from her, like, canceled their contracts with her and like, so I feel a little tumbly, you know, so, but I actually think that I don't think it's going to be hard to raise. So I'm going to, I'm going to try to go raise a million dollars. I really need, like, a I need, like, a quarter of a million to get to the next step. I really need, I really need a million to launch it. And I think that if I get a million dollars, I can launch it, like, in six months, nice, like, it'll take like, four or five months to develop with the the product design people and then my my coders, my engineers can work alongside as long as I have enough, like I have, I need money to hire a junior entrepreneur. I have a really great senior one, but he wants to have a guy that's going to just, like, do the grunt work underneath him, you know? So I need, I need the money for that. I need the money to hire the designer. But it's, it's, it's the kind of thing that can change the world. And it's like that, like the scalability of it, it's, it's also user generated content, like you,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:03:20</div><div>that's great. I mean, what's, what's your name for it?</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:03:23</div><div>Um, so I'm playing right now with uh, with a couple of names, and one of them is Neo Vita.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:03:37</div><div>So, because, like, what? Because that reminds me of, like, futuristically independently designing one's life. Yeah. Horse, new life, yeah. Oh, Neo Vita, huh, yeah, got it.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:03:56</div><div>So disco VITA is the name of my company that I founded a couple of years ago when I started life coaching. And I love the name, and I think it's really fun and cool. And so that's was that's been the working title for a while, is disco Vita, which means to discover life. It's, they're both Latin so, so it means to discover life. And I really like it. It's really fun, but Neo VITA is a little bit more literal,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>1:04:24</div><div>yeah, disco</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:04:25</div><div>Vita. Like, people are like, is it a nightclub? Is it a Yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:04:28</div><div>I don't think the average person would get that Neo Vita also kind of, yeah. It has, like a scientific sound to it. So</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:04:37</div><div><button><div> +1 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button><button><div> +1 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button>this is, this is like a pitch deck that we're working on. But, yeah, Neon Path was like another name that kind of came up in my thoughts and ideas. But Neo Vita I bought the URL neigh, the, the, what's it called? The</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:05:04</div><div>the domain? Yeah, the</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:05:06</div><div><button><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button>domain, the.com is available, but it's like, you have to negotiate with the with the seller, so I don't need to buy it yet, but that's my those. Those are my two working titles right now. I'm not, um, you know, one of the things that I've been negotiating with this design firm, because they're doing everything, like logo, branding, all this different stuff, and they're doing a bunch of UI invest, like develop, UX development and like market research and all that different stuff. So when I work with them, obviously I'm going to need to nail this stuff all down before launch, and I was trying to find out from them, like, if we needed to, if I needed to hire, like, another team to do all this kind of internal branding and, like, concept development for me, because I have, in fact, I have this other paper that I'm working with right now, which is, Like, all the internal names of things in the program that need. Let's see. Where</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>1:06:08</div><div><button><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button>did I put it.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:06:11</div><div>Have you thought of Neo path, like new path? Like New Path, forward? Kind of Neo path? Yeah, it's basically combining the two names,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:06:20</div><div><button><div> +2 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button><button><div> +2 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button><button><div> +2 </div><a><svg><title>Download</title></svg></a></button>yeah, yeah, it is. And there's look, I'm open to, like, a million different things I'm still exploring, and I just want to make sure, like, I'm trying to decide if I Oh, here it is this renaming. So let me share this. Can you see this disco be to rename? Okay, so these are all the names that I'm playing with at the moment. So also, like, dream was an original name that I had for it. It was an acronym, interesting away from that, but, you know, it was on there. And then these are, like, we're thinking of, like having names for like, the like, the instead of identity, which is kind of like a boring word, the identity can be there, but is it the actual name? So we were like, coming up with like, made up words, or like, archetype is a really cool word, but it's not like, contextually Correct. You know, Avatar. Avatar is actually the perfect word, but it's kind of been co opted already and has like, like Avatar, and its original meaning is actually really good, but I think it's just got too much contextual association in the modern world. So like, arc Avatar was another idea that I had, and then these Vita was an interesting one chat, GPT is fucking great at coming up for things, holy shit. Then we also have Dream Team, which is like the name of the whole team of your identities, the shadows. I think that's going to stay the same. Then we have like actions, which are essentially tasks, but no, nobody likes tasks, tasks or active projects, practices. So these are all the words within the program. And then I haven't finished filling it out. Like, that's on my to do list, but all the I like</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:08:10</div><div>movie poster moments. It's great. Movie</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:08:12</div><div>poster moments. That's good. It's good that you like it movies like for the visions, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>1:08:19</div><div>like, what's the movie</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:08:20</div><div>poster moment of your life that you're like, working towards, right? And that's something that I have, that I've started trademarking. My only concern was, like, is movie poster moments? Like, is it to old school? Because, like, do people even have movie posters anymore? Like, do kids even know what a movie poster is? I mean, you are, I don't really count you as a kid, but I guess technically, are</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:08:49</div><div>20, almost eight year old kid, yeah, um, I think kids know what movie posters are. It's really popular to go to the movies. Okay,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:09:00</div><div>well anyways, because that's one, you know, that's one idea that, like,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:09:04</div><div>yeah, so yeah. I mean, it'll be different. Like, Blockbuster moments would be something that lots of kids wouldn't know, because blockbuster went out so long ago. But I think movie poster</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:09:13</div><div>works, so</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:09:14</div><div>you're technically kind of still a kid. Yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:09:17</div><div>yeah. Blockbuster was around until I was a teenager. I think,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:09:22</div><div>wow. So anyways, that's, um, that's kind of where I'm at right now. I'm in, like, I'm really in this, like, just free go phase, and that's why I'm coming back to go to South by Southwest and network. Great,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:09:36</div><div>good, smart, get</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:09:38</div><div>the Bucks smart, by the way, everyone I talked to, is like, like, the last VC that I randomly met at a party was like, Here's my card. Let</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>1:09:46</div><div>me know when you're like,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:09:51</div><div>Yeah, well, step forward with the captain of your life and fucking get it.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:09:56</div><div>So that's what I'm doing. I have to go because Eric's calling me, and I might have to book him a hotel room. So anyways,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:10:04</div><div>alrighty,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:10:05</div><div>I love you. I</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:10:07</div><div>love you. Let me know what you need from me for next steps or whatever you want me to do. And this is awesome, and I'm proud of you.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:10:12</div><div>Okay, so you, oh, he's gone, so we can talk. I don't mean to rush you off the phone. No, that's fine. I'll call him back in a minute. Yeah, so your job is just noodle on those. Let them think about the groundwater. And when you come up with a list where you're like, these are all the people that I want to be every day, and feel like nothing's missing, like it really covers then let me know. And then we'll do the art, and we'll do the names. And hopefully, my my hope, is that he'll have the chat bot ready so that we can use the chat to, like, create it to be more, to help you do it expeditiously. Well,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Hannah Montemayor</div><div>1:10:48</div><div>well, I'll, I will noodle, and I'll let you know. Okay, okay, Love you. Love you.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>1:10:53</div><div>Bye, bye.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div>1:11:13</div><div>Hello,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:11:16</div><div>how are your facts? Yeah, so, yeah, I'm thinking maybe we should just make a resignation. I haven't heard back. I just texted army when I landed, but I haven't heard back from them. So and in some ways, I was kind of thinking maybe nice to just get out, have</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:11:34</div><div>your own space. And so the down, yeah, okay. And then what do you think about my theory? Because, like, the there's not, I don't think there's like a great value, even if you use your points on hammocks, like and I looked online on Chase. Chase is kind of the good one for booking hotels. I looked online. But I also don't think that there's like a super great value there. I kind of think paying like 150 bucks, or 113 bucks for one of these hotels on hotels tonight is probably like your best bet, because these are all like 130 113 140 some of them have, like, resort fees of like, 20 or 30 bucks when you check in, but it's like a total of like 500 or I can look to nine. Oh yeah, that's if you get the 130 but the one you had mentioned, I think was was a little bit higher.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:12:48</div><div>Yeah, if you want something, let me see if I can send you this so that you can look and select based on your preferences. See if I can get you on the, the,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>1:13:11</div><div>yeah, I do, actually, like, I like this site because they.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet></section>
