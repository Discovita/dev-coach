I haven't actually done this question year with anyone, because the people that I haven't worked with, I just have found out along the way. But I thought, why don't we start with like, I know that you mentioned just a little chat about you and where you're at in your life, and what would you know, what you want to what you're looking for. Okay,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>0:21</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>0:23</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>your general, um, okay, I'm like, trying thinking pillars,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>0:29</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>yeah, tell me, like, you told me that you're, you worked in tech currently, you, you're consulting, but you kind of don't have a job right now. And,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>0:39</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>yeah, okay. Like, I'd say, like, right now I'm really focused on, like, I want, I've always kind of been a contractor in tech. I want one final big job to buy the other two properties. And so, like, I have this kind of goal, like, where I want to make 300,000 right? And so I'm not going to take anything until I make that annually, and so that I can go and buy these two properties. And so, like, that's just a huge focus. And I only want to work at Airbnb. And so it's, like, I put a few kind of levers in there, and like, my whole kind of career has led to this. And that's like my capstone, and so, and the reason why I want to work there is because, like, my long term goal is financial freedom. And like, I don't need a lot. I actually, like, I have this bad business bitch side, and then I have this hippie side, and they need to kind of play alongside each other. So like, I just see, like, a couple properties to make me enough money, and then I don't have to check in on tech anymore. Yeah. So, like, that's kind of, like the financial and the career piece. And like, I think once I get to that stage in life, I can transition into, like, giving my time to help people. I'm not sure what that looks like right now, but I have a few ideas so, but that's, that's I really want to be able to transition to that, like, in my mid 40s, so six, yeah, and so then I also want to find a partner. I had had the same partner for like, three and a half, four years off and on, actually bought the house so we could be there and start our lives together. That did not happen. And so now I'm kind of like, in this devotion to self for till the end of the year, and because I also want to have kids. But like, I never thought I'd wake up at 36 and be like, Oh, I'm single and there's no babies, but that is where I'm at. And so right now I'm just like, trying to I'm working on myself, and I've never actually been alone before. So I'm like, I really want to take the rest this year to spend time alone, so that when I'm finally ready to meet the partner, like, I attract the right one. So, like, those are kind of the two things circling. I don't know if I gave you, yeah, yeah. So</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>2:33</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>yeah, we obviously have seeking energy. You're open to, like, what the world is bringing you.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>2:39</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>Yes, very open. And, like, I know this year has been, like, just so pivotal for me and like, so in like, the way that I designed my life, I this is also like, a thing that's really important to me is, like, I like to have like, a few home bases. It's like, I live in Austin, let's say, three or four months a year. Then I have, like, my Europe home base on the beach, and then I have my mountain place. And, like, that's how I call it seasonal living. And so, like, I'm really striving to get to that. So it's like, it's the kind of, like, the purpose behind it all, Yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>3:07</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>amazing. And are all the properties you own here in Austin, or do you own stuff around?</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>3:12</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>I don't own anything around yet, so it's like, yeah, but as soon as, like, the job deal is signed and like, it hits the bank and I'm gonna go and buy the next one. So, yeah, cool,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>3:23</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>perfect. I think that that is really helpful, yeah, and yeah, it's one of the things I was talking about with the with the coaches, like we also need to do, like an onboarding questionnaire, so that the AI me as a coach has some general guidelines in order to interact. So that's awesome. So thank you for sharing, and thank you for being open enough to like, you know, be open to this process and share with me. Yeah, well, now I'm going to take you through a really cool exercise that is going to help you develop. We call it. It's actually like a dream team of like, internal selves. Yeah. So have you ever heard of internal family systems? No, ifs so it's this theory that we all have like a million voices in our head, right? And that the people that the people that are crazy on the street that are like talking to themselves or have multiple personality disorder, they're just living that on the outside, but we actually all have it going on on the inside, right? Yeah, um, in the this guy's theory is that through different traumatic experiences in life, we fracture into multiple parts of ourselves interesting, and there's certain parts that are sequestered and hidden because they're too painful to face. And then there's all these protectors that are protecting them anyways. There's this whole, like myriad of fractured selves inside, and this is like a trauma theory, right? And so we are taking that same theory and making it kind of the theory of success. You have multiple people inside of you, best in the best of your life. You are expressing them all, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div>5:18</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>interesting. This</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>5:20</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>is like the thing, like, we want to, you know, you want to be an amazing businesswoman. And you, you know you want, you know, whatever, there's like, a million different things that you want your life. You want to be a businesswoman. You want a realtor. You want to get this other contract. You want to be a wife, you want to be a doctor. You want to be a mother. You know, probably have some other ambitions for you know, traveling. You want to be a seasonal liver. You want to be an early retiree. Yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>5:44</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>all the things</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>5:46</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>different parts of you are different individual selves within you that want to be expressed. And so when most people look at their lives, they organize it in these exterior buckets, like finance, career, family, whatever. And the truth is is like we're supposed to care about all that stuff, but maybe we care about like half and not the other half or whatever. And so my methodology turns it all into an identity. What is your relationship to these important buckets in your life, and who do you want to be? How do you want to show up?</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>6:25</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>Interesting. Okay, so we're going</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>6:28</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>to start by developing this sort of constellation of your internal identities that when you we're going to get to the end and get this list, and you're going to be like, if I can be all those people.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>6:41</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>Yeah. Okay, okay, you know, okay.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>6:44</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>So the very first question is, like, what are the things that you already know you are, and you can just take a piece of pepper and write it down, like, okay, you know, what are the identities that you already are? Like, this is me.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>6:59</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>Okay. Do you want to say it a lot? I know, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>7:00</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>say it. Write them down. I mean, I know, like, I'll just give you some hints of the things that you told me it's like, you're a real estate investor, or, you know, traveler, seasonal, whatever, like, so like, all these things that you know you are, things that you know you're, yeah, already expressing,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>7:17</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>well, I would go more like, I would say, like, I'm a cheerleader. Like, that's Kylie. Write it down in people's lives, yeah, a really empathetic friend, I don't know, like, I'm more like on that that you</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>7:32</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>write it all right? Now this is like a big mind dump. So whatever, we're going to do everything, and then we can, like,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>7:43</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>okay, so I'll just, I'm like, Okay, I'm extremely ambitious. I live life by my own rules.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>7:51</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>Yeah. So one thing we're going to focus on, we're going to focus on ambitious. It's not a noun, it's a descriptor. So, but you're an ambitious woman. You're AC we want these to be ownership words. I'm an ambitious seeker. I'm an ambitious like leader. I'm an ambitious whatever ambitious is a qualifier. So you want to make sure that it's a noun. And if you can't figure out a noun, just like write down what it is fine, but just know that our goal is an ownership word, something that's me, Okay,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>8:26</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>give me an give me an example, like, help me</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>8:28</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>so like a cheerleader is a noun, yeah, a an empathetic friend, okay? A because, because I'm a friend, I'm a cheerleader, I'm a I'm ambitious, is describing yourself. It's not saying I am a ambitious risk taker or I'm an ambitious Do you know what I'm saying? Like, what, what it what is it about what ownership word can you attach to that that makes it, that brings it inside of you? It's not something that's outside of you.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>8:59</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>Okay? So, like, I live my life on my own terms. We can write</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>9:07</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>it down as an idea, but the goal would be to transition it to an ownership word eventually. Okay. I mean, some people would call that a rebel.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>9:16</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>A rebel, okay, yeah, okay, interesting.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>9:18</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>Do you know what I mean? Yeah, I feel like</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>9:21</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>that's it. That's enough. That kind of, I mean, those are the identities that I live by. I mean, there's, I see the negative ones. I can write those down, like,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>9:29</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>that's a different exercise, easier to do than the good one. Yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>9:37</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>okay, um, uh.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>9:47</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>So I'm gonna say like, you're gonna write all these ones down that come naturally. Then the next layer is, what are the things that you want to be that you're not</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>9:59</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>okay? So</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>10:00</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>what are the things that you're like, you know, I want to be a millionaire. I want to be a useful retiree, or I want to be a you know, what is it you said you want to be able to to give back instead of have to work for your money, right? So, like, what are those sort of ambitious identities that maybe you don't think that you are right now, but you want to be okay. Um,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>10:27</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>money alive, incidentally,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>10:33</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>right, there you go. Perfect, yeah, wife and a mother. Um,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>10:44</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>um, okay, take care of my children. And then</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>10:55</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>an incredible ambassador that to use the proceeds to help others, yeah, and then I have time freedom to spend with the one. Okay, done. Okay,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>11:23</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>so now, so this is kind of just a starting place, and you can kind of take this and put it to the side and use it as a reference, okay?</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>11:31</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>Because now</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>11:32</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>I'm going to take you through categories that we have found that people can develop identities in to have a really like, robust and holistic, like, whole, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div>11:47</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>yeah, anything</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>11:48</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>that you have, here's the here's the cool thing about it. Anything that you don't have an identity in, or you have major resistance to any of these categories, that's where all the juicy work, an opportunity for growth is</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>12:04</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>interesting, okay,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>12:05</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>yeah, like anyone that's like or or no, like, yeah, just know that that is where you have the biggest opportunity for growth. You're not required to come up with an identity in each of these categories, but know that if you choose to skip one, you will end up coming you will realize later, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>12:28</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>that you don't</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>12:29</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>have one. And maybe, maybe it would be helpful,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div>12:32</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>right? Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah, this is like a</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>12:35</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>20 step process. So no, this is just step one, and you don't have to complete it all, okay? And your the ones that we already came up with, those are a guide. You can choose one to fit in any of these categories. But sometimes just the thought of the category is really like, revolutionary, yeah, just thinking about having an identity in one of these categories sometimes, just like, changes people's whole lives, which is really fun.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>13:04</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>It's amazing. I this is like it. I love this because I feel like, especially in that, when I live in the US, it's like we identify ourselves just by these boxes. It's like we are these, like, few things. And I just like that. This breaks that apart, because I've never agreed with it. I don't know if I'm making sense, but yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>13:22</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>yeah. Well, look, it's like, oh, what? What do you do? Oh, nice to meet you. What do you do? Yeah, what do you what's your work identity? That's the only thing that defines you, right? Or what's your relationship identity? That's</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Speaker 1</div><div>13:34</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>kind of that. Or, if you're a mom, so it's like, these three identities, and then, like, they kind of size you up by how much money you have, and then you fit inside this box of what, you know, they put this identity on you. And so I feel like this breaks that all open. It's like people are it's</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>13:47</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>also the reason that I get the fuck out of the country. Yes,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div>13:50</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>as much as I didn't live here, I didn't live here,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>13:53</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>like, oh, this stuff doesn't matter. It</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div>13:55</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>doesn't matter.

But I'm like, I need to leave. Continue. This is great. Okay, cool.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>14:13</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>So know that you can choose any of the ones that you've put here, or you might be inspired to create another right as we move through these. Okay, so, and also know the categories are not important ongoing. So not like you're looking at the categories. The categories are actually go away as soon as you have the answer. And the answer is your full list, right when we finish. Okay, so the first one is like, your passions and talents. These are the things that kind of make you uniquely you. And there's multiple of these. Some people have two, some people have four. Some people, you know, but these are the things that are like, Are you a bookworm? Are you a social butterfly? Are you like, what are you, you know, are you like, a like, like, a leader, or are you kind of like, you know, someone who loves to be a supporter, like, these are the things that are your specific personality and style.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>15:17</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>Okay, okay,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>15:25</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>from your list or what are your identities that really like?

I'm not sure the word for it. I'm going to give a little bit of context. I have, like, I've been going to church for like, two years, but it was kind of like, at first, it was free therapy for me and my ex, and then built a community around it. So it's more like a community piece, and they give really good sermons that are like TED Talks. But then there's this other side of me that's like, super Woo and into yoga. I'm like, I go to, you know, I love singing the ohms and all the blah blah blahs, and I have the sage right here burning. So like, I think, I'm like, I'm on a journey to where I'm becoming happy with nothing, but I'm not there.

I even am building a chat bot. Like I said, I'm building it. It's still rogue sometimes, but it could probably help you, once you do what I kind of want to do is, like, get into people do the first session, and then, like, set them free on the chat bot and let the chat bot finish it. Yeah, yeah, but, um, but just know that, like coming up with the creative word yeah is the end result, but it's about the journey inside yourself of like asking yourself these questions and raising them yeah in your life, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>28:39</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>okay. And it's like thinking about where I am today, and then what the highest self version would be. And kind of, it's</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>28:46</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>kind of, actually, it's not about where you are today. It's actually about where you want to be. And starting with a great example is fitness, right? You say I want to get in shape, so I need to go to the gym. Okay?</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>29:04</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>That's</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>29:05</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>energy, right? That's a certain kind of energy. Or if you say, like, I am an athlete, therefore I wake up in the morning, I go to the gym. Totally different, yes, it's</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>29:18</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>totally different statement and energy, the energy. So when</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>29:22</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>you say, like, I am a spiritual seeker, so I wake up in the morning, I do my yoga, I seek the internal peace, or like a peace seeker, or like, you know, yeah, and actually, whatever it may be, when you affirm that I am what I eventually want to be now, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>29:42</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>I</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>29:43</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>can start being it now,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>29:44</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>yeah, that's fine, got it, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>29:47</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>and then you have a much better chance of, like, having the results you want if you truly are, you know, being the athlete. Now, instead of having to, like, put yourself through some paces and earn something, whatever I am, start with the so the reason we do this program this way, it's identity first leads to action leads to results.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>30:20</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>Okay, written down.

So this manifests in people in a lot of different ways. I mean, you've got the like, Jock dudes who are like, Jim crows, right? You've got the girls who are like, look, I will never set foot in a gym, but I'm all about the ingredients and the supplements and the this and that, and so it's kind of like, how do you care for your temp? What's your brand of caring for your vessel that you live inside? And that's different than the personal appearance, which is like, how do I show up in the world is like, do I care for my physical self? And</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>31:06</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>I'm</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>31:07</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>really big into this one, especially before I was poisoned with mold. And so I have two, because I have, like, a magical healer, which is kind of, kind of like my chef, and my like, you know, herbalist, and like all of these things. And then I also have my athlete, because I'm super. I was a professional athlete for 15 years. So I, in fact, since this is such a big part of my life, I have two and so one kind of goes under my passions, which is like my magical healer, is kind of like my passion one, but it spills over into my physical appearance is my, it's actually my acrobat. So that's mine.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>31:44</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>Oh, that's nice too.

I have like trouble, because with this I I lift weights four times, like I work, you're gonna hear you probably heard a squat. I prioritize my health probably above anything else, because I feel like that sets you up for the rest of your life. But my physical, my appearance, does not show it, because there's some other stresses and things. Oh yeah. We can't way of saying it, oh,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>32:23</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>but, but I think that,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>32:26</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>yeah, we</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>32:27</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>kind of nailed that, right? Because, like, if you're like, Oh, my physical you know, my caring for my body is great, but the issue is my physical appearance. Yeah, I don't have an identity there, and I kind of struggle to decide what I want it to be. You might be able to connect it</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>32:43</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>off, yeah, yeah, okay,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>32:53</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>okay, I think on that. Okay. Is there any more? Yeah, okay,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>33:04</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>okay, familial relation. So this is how you show up in your family of origin, or in your community, or in your chosen you know, your</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>33:17</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>Yeah, family</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>33:18</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>one day, and I'll tell you that this is another one people. Some people have really strong ties. Choose, um, choose to have more than one here, which is totally welcome, depending or one like, I'll tell you, mine is empowered mother. It's how I want to show up for my future children, and also how I want to show up in my family of origin, because we didn't have that. That's why,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div>33:45</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>yeah, I</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>33:46</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>can show up and be the Empowered mother in my family.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>33:49</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>Interesting. I love that</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>33:52</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>so, so you can choose again, how it is. This is also like your you know, and I have other ones who, like, chose Big Brother because it's like, that's how I show up, for my friends, my family, for my brother. You know, I have someone else who's like, chose sister because that's how she wants to show up, even with her mom. Yeah, do you know what I'm saying? So you can choose one that captures all of it if you need more, more, but like, also your empathetic friend,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div>34:21</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>yeah, familial</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>34:22</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>relation, you know, it kind of, it's your choice, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>34:27</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>yeah, I wrote down golden retriever.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>34:31</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>You wrote down, what? Golden Retriever? Golden Retriever, okay, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>34:35</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>it's like, it's a it's someone who's loyal, like, and just will always, you know, always be there, we need some cuddles. I don't know, yeah, okay, but I want I feel like that doesn't give me a much power, you know.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>34:49</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>So I was just gonna say, and I was like, do I say</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>34:52</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>this? Though I hear</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>34:53</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>a couple of shadows creeping into your identity, I would say that Golden Retriever is probably a little bit more of a shadow response. And same with even the risk taker. And I think that you can find, yeah, the Empowered side of it. Okay, do you know what I mean? That's just my that's my initial instinct. I could be wrong.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>35:16</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>No, I love that, yeah, you know.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>35:19</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>But I think, I think it is, like, empathetic friend, or, you know, loyal friend, or present friend, or, like, loyal connector, or, you know, and I don't know what your story, your family of origin story, is, I'll tell you mine. I just skipped this one. I just didn't even have it. I was coaching people and all these things. I just didn't even have one. And Eric was saying to me, like, I really think you should consider putting mother in your thing. Because, like, he has two kids, and I mother them. And, you know, we have the desire to have our own children. And so he was like, really encouraging me. And I was like, no, no, no. Oh, really, okay, yeah, oh, I was resistant, right? And then I did all my shadow work, and I was like, oh, so basically, the anecdote to all these shadows is</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>36:10</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>familiar, yeah, Wow,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>36:13</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>interesting. So I put it in, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>36:15</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>interesting. And</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>36:16</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>so when you complete the full identity journey, because we aren't. We don't just have the light there is also the dark of ourselves. So we need to complete the whole scope, right? And when you complete the full scope, if you have something missing, you will see like, oh, well, I don't have spiritual and I all my shadows are seeking peace, and I don't have a spiritual identity, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>36:42</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>that makes sense. You probably need to go there. You know what I mean. So</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>36:47</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>it is a an algebraic equation. When you finish the whole thing, you realize, like, the balance is off here,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>36:54</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>yeah, I know. I know, yeah. And this, this one is, like, the hardest one to talk about, like I did familiar relation is like, the core of, like, what I what, like, kind of haunting me these days, you know, with life changes and things like that, yeah, and</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>37:08</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>so for you again, yeah, it can be mother,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>37:16</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>interesting, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>37:17</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>your female or wife, or whatever you choose, is like, Ah, my choice for my familiar relation is going to be wife, and I'm going to start showing up as a wife. Now. What would a wife do? Okay, I would care for myself, care for my home, care for my family, care for my Do you know what I mean? Care for my future partner. Yeah, doing all these sort of things, and when you bring that energy into your life,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>37:46</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>yeah, it's gonna be</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>37:48</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>much easier to attract its opposite.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>37:50</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>You're right. Okay, you're right. Okay, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>37:55</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>and totally scary, yeah, it's totally scary, yeah,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>38:01</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>but if I focus on that, does that, then ostracize my friendships, because now I'm focused on and prioritizing my relation as a wife, I guess a wife shows up as a good friend, yeah, yeah, okay. How does</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>38:16</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>it? Why? Why is it? Uh, well, if you believe that your relationship is going to to be a wife is going to destroy your friendships like that's probably something that's holding you back from creating that. Yeah, you know. And so how can you be a wife and honor yourself and your great friend? Obviously, you don't even have a husband to husband at this moment, so it's a great chance to practice being away without having to have it interrupt with your friends.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>38:44</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>Yes, you're right.

You're gonna sit with all Okay, the next one, which I think we just talked about, and they very well may be different, right, is romantic relation, yeah. So actually, your wife is probably your romantic relation, and then you can choose something for your familiar relation, which is also how you show up with your friends, because, because, for the the the the romantic relation, I'm sorry for the familial relation. It's also community. Familial community. You can have one of each. You can have one that embodies all of it. The idea is the energy with which you do something, and you can bring that energy to multiple quadrants of your life. Like I said, I chose empowered mother, and that's how I want to show up in my family of origin. It's also how I want to show up in my new family.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>40:07</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>In your new family.

And this one is like, we all have to go to the DMV and pay our taxes and do our dishes and clean our closet or whatever it is that we might need to do. And we all need a identity that empowers us to do those sorts of things with gratitude and grace and self like affirming.

You're loving yourself by, you know, checking the things off your list that are tedious and laborious and nobody actually wants to do. I'll tell you, mine is the captain of my life.

Then I would have to, like, cover it with something so I could walk over and everything was fine until the next so now we do it different, you know, yeah, now I feel really like that. I'm loving myself by taking, going to the dentist and like, doing these things that I'm really loving myself and affirming my right, yeah, to have, yeah, peace and I love and so there's some really cool ones that people one of the ones that somewhat successful doer, problem solver, the driver. I have another girl who chose the driver, because she's like, I've been a passenger for fucking ever.

The thing is, is that next week I'm moving out of here and leaving so and I'll get I probably won't land in Missouri until like that, so I wouldn't be able to see you until the end of next week. But if you want to see me before the end of this week, again, I'll be available. Okay,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>49:53</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>I say, let's go ahead and plan for when you're in Missouri. I think that's a good time to like, think, okay, okay, cool. And like, do you do you get to do this just as a coach with people, and then this is kind of your the transition of it, right? Is this? Yeah.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> Leigh Ann Orsi</div><div>50:07</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>So I have been coaching people one on one in this for or not even one on one. I've done groups. I've done one on one for like two years, yeah, either privately, like people hire me, yeah, but I've pretty much shifted to only I mean, and I've also done regular coaching work, but I really don't enjoy it, because I actually don't think that people's problems is the right entry point.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>50:34</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>Ah, interesting.

So right now, I'm basically only doing work that's helping me develop the technology tool. Because the biggest problem with this is not that people don't want to do it. I mean, it's about lowering the overall time input, which I think AI can do, and then secondly, it is making it accessible at any time. Or you don't have to get, like, synchronous time someone to do it.</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>51:26</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>Yeah, it's so nice.

Okay, by next week. You know, I always think by next week it's going to be better, but I think by next week it'll be better, really,</div></app-conversation-transcript-snippet><app-conversation-transcript-snippet><button></button><div> AC</div><div>52:09</div><app-internal-speaker-info-button></app-internal-speaker-info-button><div>Okay, nice.
