            conceptually, they can kind of nest under each other. So keep that
            in mind as we move forward, because we are doing, like a big list.
            But the goal is eventually to have like the perfect size where you
            can focus on all of them and they feels like they cover all of you.
            But for example, for me, I did like Chef kind of went under my

            embodied all of them, and I chose warrior to present all of that
            energy in my life. And so as we go through the next exercise, you're
            going to get to pick which ones kind of prevail, if you will, and
            which ones are going to kind of be the the star of the show, even if

            their life, they actually think of the exterior buckets like family
            and finance and work and this and instead of bringing it within you,
            it's like, who am I in relation? What is my relationship to those
            things? Who am I like, my identity towards work? How do I show up in
            work? How do I show up in family? How do I show up in those and when
            you bring the understanding inside of you and the origin inside of

            but when you say, Mother, entrepreneur, bring it inside yourself,
            it's all things that you are that are important to you, instead of

            whittle your list a little bit if you feel like, Man, this is not
            something that's super important, but this is exciting. And then
            we're also going to go through some recommended categories, and at
            the end, we're going to kind of come up with your perfect
            constellation. Cool. Sound good, yep. All right, so, um, the very
            first category is, kind of is your passion. So these are the things
            that make you uniquely you. They're kind of your personality, things
            your whatever, your skills that you've developed, things you like,
            like people who are musicians or bookworms or designers or whatever
            so. And this is a multiple category. You can choose as many as you
            want, but again, you don't want, like, 10, you know, but things that
            are your passions that kind of define you. And I would say that
            there's one that I haven't seen on there that I think really defines
            you. What is it that I'm cheating? Because I know you, I just think
            that, like you're a meticulous executor, thank you, or something

            Who is your maker of money? And this is a really good question for

            your maker of money? Like, is it, is it an entrepreneur? Is that the
            eventual goal and or is it a is it a meticulous organizer? Is it
            like, who is making the money? And the question is about, like,
            through what do you channel your energy that's going to inspire you
            when you go to make money? And it's kind of the thing, like,
            realtor, like, what you're saying is, I kind of don't want to do

            so I am. I have an entrepreneur that's my maker of money because,
            like, I'm completely unemployable, and I just do my own thing, you
            know? And so my maker of money is my entrepreneur. However, many of
            the jobs that need to get done to make money are done by my Creator.
            Like, I'm a creative person, and I make all sorts of ideas,
            marketing plans, programs, what apps like. So I'm a maker. I'm a
            creator. And a lot of my work that earns me money, my my creative
            mind is actually doing, but that's because it's more inspiring a
            creator than to and like my entrepreneur, the stuff that my
            entrepreneur does is like, sign the contracts,</div

            Creator is the one who's developing this program. My Creator is the
            one who's finding and hiring the designer, like, so when you're done
            with I'm jumping ahead a little, but when you're done with this,
            you're gonna have, like, a whole team that you can deploy in your

            So it would fall between the designer and the meticulous executor.
            Honestly, it's, it's a mix of those two roles, because, like, and
            maybe I could just air this out to you, because I've noticed it, and
            I find it interesting, and I'm putting thought into it lately. Is
            something that I've noticed is my meticulous executor is something
            that people notice about me and appreciate and trust in me to do
            work, but my designer is the thing that, like holes work into me. I
            get, I get really easy money flow when it comes through me being
            able to exercise things from a design standpoint, because it's what
            light, lights me up the most. I'm really good at executing things.
            It just doesn't like stoke my fire, but it's what people know.

            you do whatever, some of the work gets done by the meticulous
            executor, right? But that's actually going to go in a different

            of these, so this one's familial relation. So you have mom, or you
            have, in, I heard you do three of them, like mom, sister and
            daughter, right? And so, you know, you're obviously someone who has
            very strong family ties, which is beautiful. And so you get to
            decide, like, if you want to have multiple identities for family if
            you know you want to choose one for the sake of like, this embodies
            how I relate to everyone. Maybe it's sister, maybe it's mother,
            maybe it's you know you or if you say, like, look, I'm Mother, I'm a
            mother and a daughter, and those are both important for me. The
            final question that we're going to ask is, is this identity integral
            to my being, and is this something I want to focus on, nurture and
            pursue, right? And then, if not, like Sister, can nest under
            daughter, or it can nest under or all of it. Can nest under sister
            like I have my friend who chose sister as her relating because she
            was like, I would like to be more sisterly with my mom, and I would
            be more sisterly with my friends. And this is my kind of relating
            identity is I would like to be more sisterly so you kind of get
            creative license there. I don't find that many people who have too
            many familial identities, so you are very lucky.</div

            had my bio dad's last name until I was 22 and then I didn't resonate
            with it at all, and so I changed it to my stepdad last name, not
            knowing that I would get married four and a half years later. So it
            was a lot of paperwork, but I needed it. I needed off of that. It
            was like an entire new life chapter. And then as soon as I got my
            now forever last name, it was just like, okay, stop New Life chapter
            again. So it's just interesting how that happens. Names are very
            powerful, and once you stop relating to it, there's no going back.
            So let me see do the doer of things. How do I want to relate? I have

            just deciding these things the way it changes people's lives, it's

            like, almost six months at this point, basically, maybe, actually, I

            sober. So I've been like, sitting with myself a lot, not running for
            myself. And I'm having this thing where I'm like, Okay, I've done so
            much work, but there's like, something, something that I can't quite
            find where I'm having, like, continued feelings of shame that I
            can't pin, or what, like, maybe like shame or something or like
            frustration, or like, just like some sort of, like something
            unpleasant that I like, I haven't been able to find it inside of
            myself yet. I'm like, I'm doing all like, I'm meditating so much. I
            know there's, I know there's like, something behind this door with a
            question mark on it, but I have no idea what it is. And maybe I just
            found, maybe I just found a little bit of it because I didn't, I had

            exactly how to delineate this choice of like, what inspires more?
            But we do. I am statements for each one. Once you're settled like,
            you gotta sink into your identities, right? But once you've settled
            on the list, then you create a statement that's like the mission
            statement of the identity and reinforcing your best self in this
            character. So I'm inventive and courageous. I use my unique mind and
            creativity to build things other people only dream of. I believe I
            can change the world. So I'm constantly experimenting, growing in
            the healing arts. I use my wisdom to nourish and heal. I manage my

            was feeling really positive about money raising, and I feel like
            yesterday's stock market crash and everything, like, I feel like
            everyone, like, tightened the belt a little bit. I just saw a note
            about some new Trump things. It could recover and be fine, and
            people will relax. But, like, my friend just got, like, a whole
            bunch of companies from her, like, canceled their contracts with her
            and like, so I feel a little tumbly, you know, so, but I actually
            think that I don't think it's going to be hard to raise. So I'm
            going to, I'm going to try to go raise a million dollars. I really
            need, like, a I need, like, a quarter of a million to get to the
            next step. I really need, I really need a million to launch it. And
            I think that if I get a million dollars, I can launch it, like, in
            six months, nice, like, it'll take like, four or five months to
            develop with the the product design people and then my my coders, my
            engineers can work alongside as long as I have enough, like I have,
            I need money to hire a junior entrepreneur. I have a really great
            senior one, but he wants to have a guy that's going to just, like,
            do the grunt work underneath him, you know? So I need, I need the
            money for that. I need the money to hire the designer. But it's,
            it's, it's the kind of thing that can change the world. And it's
            like that, like the scalability of it, it's, it's also user

            me share this. Can you see this disco be to rename? Okay, so these
            are all the names that I'm playing with at the moment. So also,
            like, dream was an original name that I had for it. It was an
            acronym, interesting away from that, but, you know, it was on there.
            And then these are, like, we're thinking of, like having names for
            like, the like, the instead of identity, which is kind of like a
            boring word, the identity can be there, but is it the actual name?
            So we were like, coming up with like, made up words, or like,
            archetype is a really cool word, but it's not like, contextually
            Correct. You know, Avatar. Avatar is actually the perfect word, but
            it's kind of been co opted already and has like, like Avatar, and
            its original meaning is actually really good, but I think it's just
            got too much contextual association in the modern world. So like,
            arc Avatar was another idea that I had, and then these Vita was an
            interesting one chat, GPT is fucking great at coming up for things,
            holy shit. Then we also have Dream Team, which is like the name of
            the whole team of your identities, the shadows. I think that's going
            to stay the same. Then we have like actions, which are essentially
            tasks, but no, nobody likes tasks, tasks or active projects,
            practices. So these are all the words within the program. And then I
            haven't finished filling it out. Like, that's on my to do list, but

            we'll do the art, and we'll do the names. And hopefully, my my hope,
            is that he'll have the chat bot ready so that we can use the chat
            to, like, create it to be more, to help you do it expeditiously.
