I want one final big job to buy the other two properties. And so, like, I have this kind of goal, like, where I want to make 300,000 right? And so I'm not going to take anything until I make that annually, and so that I can go and buy these two properties. And so, like, that's just a huge focus. And I only want to work at Airbnb. And so it's, like, I put a few kind of levers in there, and like, my whole kind of career has led to this. And that's like my capstone, and so, and the reason why I want to work there is because, like, my long term goal is financial freedom. And like, I don't need a lot. I actually, like, I have this bad business bitch side, and then I have this hippie side, and they need to kind of play alongside each other. So like, I just see, like, a couple properties to make me enough money, and then I don't have to check in on tech anymore. Yeah. So, like, that's kind of, like the financial and the career piece. And like, I think once I get to that stage in life, I can transition into, like, giving my time to help people. I'm not sure what that looks like right now, but I have a few ideas so, but that's, that's I really want to be able to transition to that, like, in my mid 40s, so six, yeah, and so then I also want to find a partner. I had had the same partner for like, three and a half, four years off and on, actually bought the house so we could be there and start our lives together. That did not happen. And so now I'm kind of like, in this devotion to self for till the end of the year, and because I also want to have kids. But like, I never thought I'd wake up at 36 and be like, Oh, I'm single and there's no babies, but that is where I'm at. And so right now I'm just like, trying to I'm working on myself, and I've never actually been alone before. So I'm like, I really want to take the rest this year to spend time alone, so that when I'm finally ready to meet the partner, like, I attract the right one.

And that the people that the people that are crazy on the street that are like talking to themselves or have multiple personality disorder, they're just living that on the outside, but we actually all have it going on on the inside, right? Yeah, um, in the this guy's theory is that through different traumatic experiences in life, we fracture into multiple parts of ourselves interesting, and there's certain parts that are sequestered and hidden because they're too painful to face. And then there's all these protectors that are protecting them anyways. There's this whole, like myriad of fractured selves inside, and this is like a trauma theory, right?
