It's no longer who I am, right? And so then I was, well, I went through this thing. I was only 20 at the time, right? So it's kind of like that kind of tossed me up in the air, and I didn't know what it's going to do, right? And I ended up joining the military, was what I ended up doing. But I, I don't.

You don't have to make money. Okay, that would be nice. Yeah. Well, they're college students. I've taught this to college students, which is actually, like, really weird, because they've been, never been asked, like, what are their identities and who do they want to be? They are just following, yeah, like, what everyone tells them, right? So you kind of actually ruin their life when you explain all this framework to them, yeah, it's much better suited to us, right? People who do know, have a lot of experience in the world and are ready to reorganize themselves. And so the truth is, right now you do need to feed your family and get up and make money, and you have a choice of who's sitting down at the table. Is it the hard worker? Because that's what works for you, and you're not like, really trying to do anything else at the moment. Yeah, is it? Is it your problem solver? Because then you could sit down at the table and be like, instead of just driving myself through this, I'm going to be more nuanced, and I'm going to have the problem solver sit and do this work, and one of the things we're going to solve for is making it less arduous, or whatever, right? So you have a choice of who sits down at your job right now. And like, one of the a great example of this is, like, you know, one of the women that I worked with as a mom, and she was, like, after doing this with you, like, I was doing the dishes as a vision of love instead of as, like, the pissed off mom with a dirty house, yeah?",

And I'll tell you that that's why I didn't have one, because it was something that, like, I didn't want to deal with, right? Yeah, I've started to, you know, kind of tiptoe back into the realm, certainly not in the religious side, but more on the you know, kind of more woo spirituality is like more my brand, you know, and, and, you know, the other reason is just that you kind of neglected it, right? Those are kind of the two, the two reasons. And so when it's a when it's a trauma avoidance, there's a rusty tractor down there, to one day when it's just neglect, you know, because you're doing too much of the other two, it can really bring you back into balance. So I do, and even though I'm someone who doesn't have, like, a very developed I would say mine is, I would say mine is more like health anyways, I have an interesting view on that as well, but like mine, is more health related. Would be my spiritual stuff, healing and, you know, that sort of stuff, but, but I know that there's a big part of my life to address there, and I know that my life will get better when I, you know, and I've had periods where I was like a really big meditator, and that really brought me a lot of peace like so there is always, there's rooms to grow.

That, I think that those of us who's completely abandoned the trappings of religion have lost some of its value, whereas we see the extreme of like, you don't use your fucking brain right as a negative. However, there is a sense of peace, a sense of surrender, and a sense of like, it's not my fucking job, yeah, and that we're not supposed to operate at that like, like being all the time so, so, and I'll say that, like, I'm one of the people that, like the spiritual one is, is is crunchy for me, like a struggle with it. But I also see the value, and I do see the peace that people who have one have and I honor its value. And so I find that people who don't have a spiritual identity, when we get deeper into work, we get deeper into the shadow work, you actually realize that that's actually what you need to soothe all of your shadows that are protecting you. They're protecting you from the fact. Fact that you don't have anything like this to help you, yeah. And so I find it actually to be circularly relevant in the overall like, wellness of a human. And so I think that there is a place for it. And you know, the Christian entrapments of our youth, it's that's not the only answer, and we don't need to, like, cast off the entire category because of our narrow experience.

Mimic your response needs to, you know, yes, something like that, right? So you have, you pull out all these real world examples for and you could also do a bunch of brilliant, like sophisticated things where you go through, and you take all of these recorded conversations and you tag them all with different steps, because we have all the steps identified. And we say, this one goes with this step, this one goes with this step. And you say, Okay, look in the database. That takes no time at all. It pulls out these things.
