Django Signal: Trigger Sentinel User Notes Extraction on New User Message

This module uses Django's signal framework to watch for new ChatMessage objects.
When a new message is created with role USER, it triggers a Celery task to extract/update user notes.

How it works:
- Django's post_save signal is emitted after a model's save() method completes.
- We connect a receiver function to ChatMessage's post_save signal.
- If the new message is from a USER, we schedule the extract_user_notes Celery task.
- We use delay_on_commit to ensure the task runs only after the database transaction is committed (avoids race conditions).

This decouples the note extraction logic from the main request/response cycle, keeping the app responsive.
