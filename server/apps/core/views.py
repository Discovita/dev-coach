# Step-by-step for enums endpoint:
# 1. Handle GET requests to /api/enums/.
# 2. Collect all possible values for each enum (coach_state, allowed_actions, context_keys).
# 3. Return them in a single JSON response for use in frontend dropdowns/selects.
# 4. Each enum is returned as a list of objects with 'value' and 'label' for display and value use.
