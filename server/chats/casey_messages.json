But willpower always runs out, right?\n\nWhat we're going to do differently is start with Identity. So instead of forcing yourself to go to the gym, you become a Warrior who naturally trains.

This is a little different than how you present yourself to the world. Think of it as how you care for your vessel—your body as the vehicle that carries you through life. Some people are all about movement and fitness, others focus on nutrition, and some just want to feel strong and capable for the things they love to do.\n\nHow would you describe your approach to caring for your body?

    "content": "That makes total sense, Casey. Wanting to look nice and appreciating the idea of working out—even if time is tight—says a lot about your values here. For some people, this identity is about being a “Mover” or a “Maintainer”—someone who keeps their body in good working order, even if it’s not about hitting the gym every day. Others resonate with words like “Capable,” “Active,” or even “Steady.”\n\nDoes any of that feel right to you? Or is there another word or phrase that captures how you relate to your physical health and energy? No pressure to get it perfect—we can always refine it later."

    "content": "\"Maintainer\" is a strong choice, Casey. It really honors the part of you that values keeping your body in good working order, even if life doesn’t always allow for a perfect workout routine. I’ll capture that as your Physical Expression identity.\n\nNow, let’s shift to your family relationships. This is a space where you can have more than one identity if you want—since family can mean so many things and you play different roles with different people. You’ve shared about your wife, your two children, your mother-in-law living with you in Spain, and also some of the complexities with your brothers and the influence of your grandmother.\n\nWhen you think about how you show up in your family—either as a dad, a partner, a son-in-law, or even in relation to your family of origin—what identity or identities feel true for you? Is there a word or phrase that captures how you want to be seen or how you naturally show up in those relationships?"

Words like “Anchor,” “Rock,” or even “Foundation” come to mind—something that conveys stability, support, and reliability for your wife and kids. \n\nDoes one of those words resonate with you, or is there another that feels even more true to how you want to show up for your family?"

I’ll lock that in as your Familial Relations identity.\n\nNow, let’s move from family to your romantic and intimate relationship. This is a space where the energy might be different from your role as a family pillar. When you think about how you show up—or want to show up—as a partner to your wife, what identity name feels true? Is there a word or phrase that captures the energy you want to bring to your romantic relationship?"

We can always circle back if you want to revisit it later.\n\nLet’s keep our momentum going and move to the next area: the part of you that gets things done—the doer, the finisher, the one who takes action. When you think about how you approach tasks, projects, or just making things happen in your life, is there a word or phrase that captures that energy for you? For example, some people resonate with names like “Executor,” “Finisher,” “Driver,” or even something more playful like “Taskmaster.”\n\nWhat comes to mind for you? Or would you like to talk it through a bit first?"

It’s not just about getting things done, but about leading with intention and harmony.\n\nAre you happy with \"Conductor\" as your identity for this area, or would you like to play with the wording a bit more? If it feels right, I’ll lock it in and we’ll celebrate completing your foundational set of identities!"
